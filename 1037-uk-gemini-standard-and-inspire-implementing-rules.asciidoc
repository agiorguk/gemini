= UK-GEMINI Standard and Inspire Implementing Rules

include::./includes/attributes.asciidoc[]

== Introduction{nbsp} _(GEMINI 2.3, June 2018)_

This section of the website is for those producing or maintaining
metadata for geographic information.

It describes the requirements and guidance for metadata conforming to
the UK standard known as UK GEMINI. Conformance to GEMINI should ensure
conformance to the INSPIRE Implementing Rules. UK specific guidance is
provided.

Both UK GEMINI and the INSPIRE Technical Guidance have been developed
from the International
Standard{nbsp}http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=26020[ISO
19115:2003]{nbsp}Geographic information - Metadata, with supplementary
material from ISO 19119:2005 Geographic information - Services. The XML
encoding follows ISO 19139:2007 Geographic information - Metadata - XML
encoding.

If you're thinking, why GEMINI? Why not just use the INSPIRE Metadata
guidance or the ISO
standards?{nbsp}https://www.agi.org.uk/why-uk-gemini/[Click here for some
reasons.]

The requirements and guidance are comprehensive and accessible whether
the metadata is about datasets and dataset series, or services. It
should prove of value not only to those documenting metadata about
geographic data and services, but also those responsible for encoding
the metadata. Note that GEMINI (and the INSPIRE Guidance) are about
metadata for datasets, series, and services (collectively, 'resources');
not everything in a GEMINI record can be assumed to be true individually
for each feature instance in the resource. The underlying ISO standards
(19115, 19139) do allow for metadata at the instance level.

The information here has been derived from a number of sources
originally created as standalone documents which partially overlapped in
their scope. For GEMINI 2.3, the content of these documents has been
aggregated and presented in a more consistent and complete manner. The
original documents relating to GEMINI 2.2 and the INSPIRE Implementing
Rules remain available on
the{nbsp}https://www.agi.org.uk/uk-gemini/[AGI{nbsp}]and{nbsp}UK Location{nbsp}websites.
This work was sponsored by{nbsp}Defra, and carried out by members of
the{nbsp}https://www.agi.org.uk/agi-uk-gemini/[AGI GEMINI Working Group].

of changes]{nbsp}from earlier versions.

Here is
a{nbsp}https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1250-element-summary/[summary]{nbsp}of
the GEMINI elements (similar to Table 1 and Table 2 in GEMINI 2.2).

Note: in GEMINI 2.3, the GEMINI Element number is called "GEMINI id";
the actual numbers have not changed, where the same element was in
GEMINI 2.2.

=== Feedback

This is a new service which we hope will provide better and more
accessible information for the metadata compiler and also lead to
improvements in the quality of metadata collected. By publishing the
content on the web, it will mean that any changes, such as those to the
INSPIRE Implementing Rules can be published more quickly.

We realise that the various aspects of the website could be improved and
that there may be some errors and inconsistencies in the content,
therefore we would like to hear from you if you spot any of these or you
would like to see improvements in terms of presentation and usability.
