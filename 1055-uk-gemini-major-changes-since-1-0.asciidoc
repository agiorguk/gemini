==== April 2020

Changed
the{nbsp}https://www.agi.org.uk/40-gemini/1048-uk-gemini-encoding-guidance[XML
guidance]{nbsp}and examples to cope with the disappearance of the XML
resources
from{nbsp}http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/ISO_19139_Schemas/.

==== March 2019

Change
to{nbsp}https://www.agi.org.uk/40-gemini/1048-uk-gemini-encoding-guidance#2.1,[https://www.agi.org.uk/1048-uk-gemini-encoding-guidance#2.1,]{nbsp}to
describe a wider choice of relevant XML Schema Definition Files (XSDs)
that can be used to validate GEMINI instances.

https://www.agi.org.uk/40-gemini/1062-gemini-datasets-and-data-series#8[_Dataset_{nbsp}reference
date]: removed mention of the maximum occurrence for service records,
when viewing this element for dataset records.

Corrected the INSPIRE "corresponding element" entry
for{nbsp}https://www.agi.org.uk/40-gemini/1062-gemini-datasets-and-data-series#41[Conformity],{nbsp}https://www.agi.org.uk/40-gemini/1062-gemini-datasets-and-data-series#4[Abstract],{nbsp}https://www.agi.org.uk/40-gemini/1062-gemini-datasets-and-data-series#5[Topic
category],{nbsp}https://www.agi.org.uk/40-gemini/1062-gemini-datasets-and-data-series#6[Keyword],{nbsp}https://www.agi.org.uk/40-gemini/1062-gemini-datasets-and-data-series#17[Spatial
reference
system],{nbsp}https://www.agi.org.uk/40-gemini/1062-gemini-datasets-and-data-series#21[Data
format],{nbsp}https://www.agi.org.uk/40-gemini/1062-gemini-datasets-and-data-series#45[File
Identifier],{nbsp}https://www.agi.org.uk/40-gemini/1062-gemini-datasets-and-data-series#47[Hierarchy
level name],
and{nbsp}https://www.agi.org.uk/40-gemini/1062-gemini-datasets-and-data-series#48[Quality
scope].

Corrected the "corresponding element" entries for service elements to
reference ISO 19119
for{nbsp}https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1063-gemini-services#15[Extent],{nbsp}https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1063-gemini-services#16[Vertical
extent
information],{nbsp}https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1063-gemini-services#37[Spatial
data service type],
and{nbsp}https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1063-gemini-services#38[Coupled
resource].

Corrected the ISO 19139 "corresponding element" entries for service
elements{nbsp}https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1063-gemini-services#15[Extent],{nbsp}https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1063-gemini-services#16[Vertical
extent information],
and{nbsp}https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1063-gemini-services#18[Spatial
resolution]

Corrected the ISO 19139 "corresponding element" entries
for{nbsp}https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1062-gemini-datasets-and-data-series#1[Title],{nbsp}https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1062-gemini-datasets-and-data-series#2[Alternative
title],
and{nbsp}https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1062-gemini-datasets-and-data-series#4[Abstract].

_Note: these are all minor corrections of the way the element is
referenced, rather than substantive changes to which element we consider
equivalent. The largest impact is to note that INSPIRE only allows one
Quality scope element - i.e. the metadata has to describe the whole
dataset._

==== January 2019

New{nbsp}Schematron package, in which the only change is to the "Technical
Documentation" file (to version 1.7.1), clarifying in one paragraph that
the Schematron file itself changed from 2.2 to 2.3, but the way one
should use it didn't.

==== October 2018

*https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1062-gemini-datasets-and-data-series#27[Additional
information]{nbsp}(source)
and{nbsp}https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1062-gemini-datasets-and-data-series#19[Resource
locator]*

Clarified that, in line with the underlying ISO standards, Resource
locator is for links to access the resource, or obtain more information
about accessing the resource. Links to further information about the
resource itself, e.g. a user guide, should go in Additional information

Note: this is a change from the earlier UK Location guidance, which
wanted all URLs (except licensing) in Resource locator.

The actual changes are in the 'purpose and meaning', guidance, and
examples of both elements. Also noted that there is an INSPIRE element
corresponding to Additional information, although it is only mentioned
in an Annex of the Technical Guidance. We have also changed the name
from 'Additional information source' to 'Additional information',
because it is quite possible to provide the information in line, rather
than by citation or link.

Note: additional information is not available for services.

*https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1062-gemini-datasets-and-data-series#36[Resource
identifier]*

Fixed two typos.

We have also turned internal cross references from one element to
another, into hyperlinks.

==== September 2018

*https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1062-gemini-datasets-and-data-series#3[Dataset
language]{nbsp}and{nbsp}https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1062-gemini-datasets-and-data-series#33[metadata]https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1062-gemini-datasets-and-data-series#33[{nbsp}language]*

Corrected the name of the Irish language.

*https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1062-gemini-datasets-and-data-series#17[Spatial
reference
system]{nbsp}and{nbsp}https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1062-gemini-datasets-and-data-series#48[Quality
scope] +
*

Corrected that there is an equivalent INSPIRE requirement, although not
a 'named' metadata element.

*https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1062-gemini-datasets-and-data-series#25[Limitations
on public access]*

Corrected the equivalent ISO 19115 & 19139 elements

*https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1062-gemini-datasets-and-data-series#26[Use
constraints]*

Corrected encoding rules & examples, from "gmd:LegalConstraints" (which
doesn't exist) to "gmd:MD_LegalConstraints".

Corrected the service Example One.

Corrected the equivalent ISO 19115 & 19139 elements.

==== August 2018

*Description of validation*

Fixed the description in section 1.5 of
the{nbsp}https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1053-common-metadata-errors-uk-location-discovery-metadata-service[Common
Metadata Errors article], which only described the GEMINI 2.2 / UK
Location / data.gov.uk validation.

*Parent identifier*

Corrected to be slightly different guidance for service metadata.

*Spatial data service type*

Given that it is only relevant to service metadata, corrected the
obligation (in that context) to mandatory

*Minimum length of Abstract*

Add mention in the guidance that the Schematron will complain if it's
<100 characters

*INSPIRE Default CRSs*

Fixed the reference - the list of INSPIRE CRSs is in Annex D.4 of the
Metadata TG, not the Regulations

==== July 2018

*https://www.agi.org.uk/40-gemini/1048-uk-gemini-encoding-guidance[UK
GEMINI Encoding Guidance]*

*first line*: remove misleading phrase "using XSD schemas"* +
*

*section 2.2.14*: minor clarifications, and improved the placement of
figure captions.

*Change log{nbsp}*(this article): reordered to bring newest to top; added
this section (editorial changes)

https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1037-uk-gemini-standard-and-inspire-implementing-rules["*Home
page*"]: fixed link to encoding guidance

*https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1052-metadata-guidelines-for-geospatial-data-resources-part-1[Guidelines
- part 1 Introduction to Metadata]*: clarifications & general update
