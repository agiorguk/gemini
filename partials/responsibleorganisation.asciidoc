|Guidance a|
. The organisation name, email address and responsible party role are
mandatory. Other entries should only be given that are relevant and
known.
. Where no single individual is responsible, a generic role may be
given.
. Where there are multiple Distributors / Responsible Organisations,
then a separate entry should be given for each.
. For dataset and dataset series, one of the Responsible Organisations
must be in the role of Distributor (If there is only one Responsible
Organisation recorded, then it must be in the role of Distributor.).
. Where there are several distributors, a separate entry should be given
for each.
. For best result with data.gov.uk:
* Enter 'Owner' for UK Location Data Provider role.
* Enter 'Publisher' For UK Location Data Publisher role.
+
These appear in the data.gov.uk search results.
. If the data was created by someone other than the Data Provider, this
should also be recorded, using the role value 'Originator'.
. If you need to identify an individual by name, use CI_ResponsibleParty.individualName.

GEMINI 1 to 2.0: This has been generalised from Distributor (and
Originator) to cover a range of possible roles, by the addition of
'responsible party role' and minor errors in the class details have been
corrected.

|Guidelines

. The encoding example for responsible organisation is shown below. The
example shows the minimum required information.
. The format of address and contact information is described at
xref:1048-uk-gemini-encoding-guidance#_responsible_party[Responsible party], with a
more fully populated example.
. Note on role code: the UK Location portal (data.gov.uk site)
interprets ISO 'owner' as Data Provider, and ISO 'publisher' as Data
Publisher.
