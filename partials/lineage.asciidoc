|Definition |Information about the events or source data used in the
construction of the data resource

|Purpose and meaning |The purpose of this element is to give an
indication of how the data resource was created. It is useful in
determining its fitness for purpose.

|Obligation |Mandatory

|Occurrence |Single

|Data type |CharacterString

|Domain |Free text

|Guidance a|
. Some information should be provided. Include statements on the
following:
* source material
* processes used to create the data, including resolution of measurement
* method of updating
* any quality control processes
. Acronyms should be expanded to the full name along with the
abbreviated version at the beginning of the lineage. The abbreviated
version can then be used.

|Comment |This element is similar to Abstract, and some information may
be included in either element. +
Further details included in an external file may be referenced under
link:#27[Additional information].

|Examples |Addresses are taken from the Postcode Address File (PAF) and
the property found on the large-scale Ordnance Survey map. The
coordinates of an approximate centroid for the property are recorded to
a resolution of 1 metre. The dataset is updated from the PAF monthly
updates. All results are checked by plotting a group of related
addresses on the map and visually checking for errors.

|Guidelines
|. The encoding for lineage is shown in the example below.
. Note that, in addition to the lineage statement, the data quality
scope shall be encoded. For dataset metadata instances the MD_ScopeCode
code list value shall be 'dataset'. For series metadata instances the
code list value shall be 'series'.
. For INSPIRE, the lineage statement must appear in the
gmd:dataQualityInfo/gmd:DQ_DataQuality element scoped to the entire
described dataset or series
