|Definition |Format in which the digital data is provided

|Purpose and meaning |The purpose of this element is to identify the
various options for data formats that may be provided.

|Occurrence |Multiple

|Data type |Class MD_Format from ISO 19115

|Domain a|
The following properties are expected:

|Guidance a|
. Entries should be recognised formats for data transfer, either
standard or proprietary.
. Recommended best practice is to use a human readable term from a
controlled vocabulary.
. If the data resource is not downloadable (e.g. is view only), then
this should be stated.

|Comment |If the version of the data encoding is unknown or not
versioned, a nil reason attribute shall be specified with either
"unknown" or "inapplicable" values used correspondingly.

Metadata errors observed...

|===
|Errors observed |*No Format provided* - +
ISO 19139 requires that a format is given, either within the
'distribution' section or the 'distributor' section. +
INSPIRE & UK GEMINI encoding guidance only expects the distribution
section, as the place to encode the Resource locator, +
which effectively renders distribution format mandatory.
