=== Preface

This is the second part of a set of guidelines for metadata for
geospatial data resources. These metadata guidelines are primarily
concerned with geospatial data (i.e. that which references data to a
location on the surface of the Earth), and which has a limited
geographic extent (i.e. is restricted to a defined territory). The
guidelines have been developed within the context of a UK Location
Discovery metadata service meeting the requirements of the EU INSPIRE
Directive and the UK GEMINI2 metadata standard. However, they are
sufficiently broadly based to be applicable in a wider context of
geospatial metadata creation and management.

The Guidelines are aimed at data managers and creators of metadata,
providers of metadata services and general data users. They include
guidance on quality management such that they could be used in the
context of a national metadata service.

https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1052-metadata-guidelines-for-geospatial-data-resources-part-1[Part
1 of the Guidelines{nbsp}]covers the basics of metadata and provides an
introduction to the other two parts. It includes a glossary of terms and
set of references. Part 3
[https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1047-metadata-guidelines-for-geospatial-data-resources-part-3[3]]
deals with metadata quality and covers quality evaluation and quality
management of metadata including guidance on establishing acceptable
quality levels. This Part of the Guidelines provides a set of detailed
guidelines for UK GEMINI2 metadata elements. It has been revised to
correspond to version 2.3 of UK GEMINI.

Any comments on these guidelines or on the UK GEMINI2 metadata standard
should be sent
to{nbsp}gemini@agi.org.uk.

=== [#intro]##{nbsp}1. Introduction

UK GEMINI2 defines a core set of metadata elements for discovery of data
resources and other essential purposes. It provides details of what
metadata should be collected for geospatial data resources and is
designed for use in a geospatial discovery metadata service. The data
resources may be datasets, dataset series, services delivering
geographic data, or any other information resource with a geospatial
content. This includes datasets that relate to a limited geographic
area. The data resources may be graphical or textual (tabular or free
text), hardcopy or digital.

This part of the{nbsp}_Metadata Guidelines for Geospatial Data
Resources_{nbsp}provides detailed guidance for the application of UK GEMINI2.
It is aimed at those creating metadata conforming to UK GEMINI2. This
expands on existing guidance given in the UK GEMINI2
specification[https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1047-metadata-guidelines-for-geospatial-data-resources-part-3[4]].
It also describes possible errors that might occur in such metadata and
suggests actions to guard against them. It explains how to expand the
metadata elements in addition to those in UK GEMINI2 if required, and
how to extend code lists of allowable values.

This Part should be read in conjunction with the other parts of these
guidelines.

=== [#gemini]##{nbsp}2. GEMINI2

==== *_[#2.1]####2.1 Metadata elements_*

UK GEMINI2 specifies a set of metadata elements for describing
geospatial data resources. These resources may be a dataset, data set
series (collection of datasets with a common specification) or data
service. The type of resource is identified in the element Resource Type
(39). The metadata elements are summarised
in{nbsp}https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1250-element-summary[element
summary].

Detailed guidance on how to create each of these elements can be found
here:

https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1027-citizens-as-sensors-a-solution-to-pollution[GEMINI
- Datasets and data series]

GEMINI - Services

==== *_[#2.2]####2.2 Additional metadata elements_*

In many organisations, there is a need to record additional items of
metadata to meet specific local requirements. This may be to incorporate
particular characteristics of the data resources, or for particular
applications. Additional metadata elements may be included in a metadata
implementation. These elements should be taken from ISO
19115{nbsp}_Geographic information -
Metadata{nbsp}_[https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1047-metadata-guidelines-for-geospatial-data-resources-part-3[18]],
which includes a comprehensive collection of metadata elements for
geographic information. An example would be Dataset character set and
Metadata character set where non-standard characters are used.

==== *_[#2.3]####2.3 Extension of code lists_*

Several of the metadata elements specified in UK GEMINI2 use enumerated
code lists. These are pre-defined sets of values identified by codes.
They are useful to standardise the entries to aid searches of metadata
for specified values. The code lists included in UK GEMINI2 are taken
from ISO 19115. In some cases, the explanations of the values have been
modified to make them more appropriate to the UK context.

Some of these code lists will require extension. Additional codes may be
created as follows:

. Identify the new value, which should be distinct from existing values;
. Choose a name that encapsulates the essential concept;
. Provide a definition that is understandable and concise;
. Choose a new code that has not been used before for this element;
. Document the new codes, and disseminate them to users.

Such code extensions may be either specific to a metadata implementation
in an organisation or sector, or for general usage. In the latter case,
proposed new codes should be submitted
(to{nbsp}mailto:standards@agi.org[gemini@agi.org.uk)
for inclusion in the next version of UK GEMINI2. It is expected that
future editions of UK GEMINI will incorporate such modified code lists.

*Note that any new code values cannot be used in a national metadata
service until incorporated in the Standard, neither will they be valid
for the purposes of INSPIRE.*

=== [#errors]##{nbsp}3. Possible metadata errors

==== *_[#3.1]####3.1 Impact of metadata errors_*

Errors having the greatest impact are likely to be those that affect
searches based on:

* *Where?*{nbsp}- geographical extent expressed in latitude and longitude or
some named standard area (e.g. administrative area, postcode, country);
* *What?*{nbsp}- theme, subject or topic;
* *When?*{nbsp}- date when data resource was current.

Errors in the metadata elements used by these searches will result in
over- or under-selection of data resources and will degrade the quality
of the discovery service that is providing the search facility.
Inconsistencies in the capture or updating of metadata, such as the
categorisation of data subject or topic, will further erode the quality
of the discovery service.

==== *_[#3.2]####3.2 Effect on searches_*

Having discovered a number of candidate data resources, the discovery
service user then assesses the likelihood that any of these meet their
requirements. They will need the information in the other metadata
elements such as abstract, lineage, data format, and constraints to make
their assessment. Inaccuracies, inconsistencies, or incompleteness will
detract from the quality of the discovery service.

Information also needs to be topical or up-to-date. Discovery services
are bedevilled by metadata containing information current at the
inception of the service but never maintained since. The service user
needs to have reliable information about where they can find out more
about the data resource and how they can obtain that resource. It is not
uncommon for this to be out-of-date or have incorrect URLs or contact
details.

==== *_[#3.3]####3.3 Prevention and correction of errors_*

Prevention and correction of these errors is usually a combination of:

* Understanding the nature of the errors;
* Clear guidance on avoidance of errors at time of entry – metadata
capture tools may help here in validating entries;
* Staff trained in metadata capture who understand the nature of the
data resources being documented;
* Independent quality control with specified quality evaluation
procedures, acceptable quality levels and procedures for dealing with
metadata that fails;
* Periodic reviews of existing metadata to check that all information is
current;
* Procedures for dealing with errors reported by service providers or
users;
* Overall quality assurance process which reviews procedures in the
light of experience and aims to improve overall metadata quality.

Further guidance on how to prevent and correct errors is given in Part 3
[https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1047-metadata-guidelines-for-geospatial-data-resources-part-3[3]]{nbsp}of
these Guidelines.

==== *_[#3.4]####3.4 Common errors_*

Some common errors that lead to inconsistent results when searching
across metadatasets are:

* Documentation is too general;
* Extent is over-generalised;
* Subjects and topic categories are under-reported;
* Incorrect or inconsistent date entries;
* Different names are used for the same item in different places;
* Missing values;
* Data is not current.

The nature and impact of these types of error are described in more
detail below, together with suggested ways in which these errors can be
prevented or corrected.

[width="100%",cols="25%,25%,25%,25%",options="header",]
|===
|*Type of error* |*Description and impact* |*Examples of errors*
|*Prevention or correction*
|Documentation too general |There are no absolute rules about how data
resources should be “chunked” and individually documented. A metadata
record can therefore refer to a dataset covering a single topic relating
to a small area or major dataset series covering all or parts of UK
containing many topics. This can lead to inconsistent search results
with either over- or under-selection of data resources. a|
. Topographic mapping covering whole of GB at different scales to
different specifications documented using one metadata record.
. Reports produced by an organisation relating to a variety of locations
and dates documented using one metadata record.

a|
Have clear guidance on the “chunking” of data resources for individual
documentation[See{nbsp}https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1052-metadata-guidelines-for-geospatial-data-resources-part-1[Part
1 of these Guidelines]] based on:

. how the data is used (stand-alone or as part of wider set);
. continuity and extent of coverage;
. date of capture or maintenance;
. topics or subjects covered, and
. uniformity of specification within data resource.

Introduce checks to ensure consistency of approach across all metadata.

|Extent over-generalised |This particularly applies when extent is
described in terms of standard geographical areas such as postcode
districts, counties, or countries. Inconsistencies in relating data
resource coverage to these areas and the use of different extent names
to refer to the same coverage results in either over- or under-selection
of data resources. a|
. Coverage given as UK or GB when restricted to England.
. Coverage of UK referred to as GB.
. Coverage given as England when restricted to Hampshire only.

a|
Have clear rules and user guidance on the relating of named extents to
the coverage of data resources and guidelines on the types of extents to
be used. Where named extents form part of a nesting hierarchy (e.g.
administrative areas) then any guidance should cover the possible need
for inclusion of levels in the hierarchy.

Introduce checks to ensure consistency of approach across all metadata.

|Subjects and topic categories under-reported |This particularly applies
where there are enumerated lists of topics. Inconsistency in the
inclusion of individual topics can lead to over- or under-selection of
data resources. |Metadata for topographic map series does not include
boundaries, elevation, inland waters, structure, and transportation as
topics. a|
Use guidance on the recording of topics or themes to promote
consistency.

Use closed lists wherever possible and discourage the use of free text.

Introduce checks to ensure consistency of approach across all metadata.

|Incorrect or inconsistent date entries a|
There is often confusion between the date that the data was current, the
date when the data was captured or last updated and the date when the
data resource was released, published or made available.

There can be further inconsistencies between the frequency of update and
the recorded currency of the data resource. This can lead to {nbsp} false
returns for searches based on dates.

a|
. Date of capture of data resource later than date of publication.
. Update reported as continuous but date of last update reported as 10
years ago.

a|
Use guidance on the recording of different dates to promote consistency.

Introduce checks, preferably by software, to ensure that the ordering of
dates is consistent.

|Same item, different name |This is particularly relevant where there is
no closed list but a name or descriptor recurs which is common to many
metadatasets. This may lead to inconsistent results or, more frequently
misinterpretation of results. |National Grid, British National Grid,
National Grid of Great Britain. a|
Include frequently used standard names in any internal guidance.

Introduce checks to ensure consistency of approach across all metadata.

|Missing values |Omission of values relating to extent, date or topic
will have great impact on searches since these are the usual criteria
used. a|
. Omission of geographical extent.
. Omission of dataset reference date.
. Missing topic categories.

|Introduce checks, preferably software checks, to ensure that mandatory
fields contain values.

|Information not current |This can impact both on searches and the
interpretation of search results since the metadata does not reflect the
current information or only does so partially. a|
. Content of data resource extended but no change to topic categories.
. Abstract not updated to reflect change of specification.
. Data resource updated but later date not entered in the metadata.

|Introduce a regime of regular checks on all metadata to ensure that
currency is assessed and updates made where needed.
|===

Other errors that may lead to misinterpretation of results are:

* Correct value, but for the wrong metadata element;
* Values incorrect, incomplete or inaccurate;
* Incomprehensible, misleading or uninformative entries.

The nature and impact of these types of error are described in more
detail below, together with suggested ways in which these errors can be
prevented or corrected.

[width="100%",cols="25%,25%,25%,25%",]
|===
|*Type of error* |*Description and impact* |*Examples of errors*
|*Prevention or correction*

|Correct value, wrong metadata element |Confusion between the
definitions of metadata elements can lead to correct values entered
against the wrong metadata element. a|
. Lineage information given for abstract.
. Limitations on public access given for use constraints.

a|
Use guidance on the definition and use of the metadata elements
especially those most commonly confused (see examples).

Introduce training and checks to ensure correct use of elements.

|Values incorrect, incomplete or inaccurate |This can apply to both
quantitative and non-quantitative entries and can impact on the way that
results are interpreted and used. a|
. URL given as additional information source incorrect and not
accessible.
. Contact details for obtaining data resource are incorrect.

|Check values are correct as far as can be established e.g.
independently check URLs, contact details.

|Incomprehensible, misleading or uninformative{nbsp} entries |Entries need to
be understandable by the discovery service user who needs to interpret
the search results. The impact can be that results are misinterpreted
and candidate datasets ignored. a|
. Where dataset does not have a recognised title, uninformative title
given.
. Abstract is uninformative with no information on content.
. Lineage contains no information about sources or reasons for creation.
. Use of terms and abbreviations unlikely to be understood by service
user.

|Use guidance and checklists for compiling entries e.g. abstracts.
