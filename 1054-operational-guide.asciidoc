=== [#Intro]####1. Introduction

The UK Location Discovery Metadata Service (DMS) lies at the heart of UK
Location and the delivery of the UK Location Strategy and INSPIRE - 'to
know what data we have'.

The DMS underpins the coordinated and regulated publishing of public
sector location information to the INSPIRE and UK Location specified
standards. It provides the discovery component for a set of on-line
services that will allow data users to evaluate and use public sector
location information, that is to view, download and invoke as part of an
end business application.

This guide sets out detailed guidance on the creation, publishing and
maintenance of UK Location discovery metadata.

It covers both location information being published under INSPIRE and
all other location information published through UK Location. The DMS is
being implemented by extending the functionality of the UK public data
publishing platform{nbsp}http://data.gov.uk/[data.gov.uk].

The guide is a living document and will be continuously revised in the
light of operational experience and feedback.

Please note that whilst the Devolved Administrations of Scotland, Wales
and Northern Ireland are part of UK Location, they may have different
publishing mechanisms to those described here. Therefore in the first
instance, please use the appropriate contact information listed under
“Where to obtain more information” below.

==== *[#1.1]####1.1 Target Audience*

The primary audience for the Guide are business managers and information
officers, located within data provider organisations, and their
technical partners.

It is chiefly written for those data providers who have obligations
under the INSPIRE Themes, but is also relevant to those who wish to
publish location information into UK Location on a voluntary basis.

The guide will also be of interest to anyone who requires a general
understanding of the UK Location Discovery Metadata Service and how it
is intended to operate.

==== *[#1.2]####1.2 Assumed Knowledge*

This guide assumes that the reader is familiar with the creation and
management of metadata and has read the UK Location “Getting Started'
series of
guides[https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1047-metadata-guidelines-for-geospatial-data-resources-part-3[27]].

Readers requiring an introduction to discovery metadata for geospatial
data resources are referred to the UK GEMINI guide
“https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1052-metadata-guidelines-for-geospatial-data-resources-part-1[Metadata
Guidelines for Geospatial Data Resources, Introduction – Part
1]”[https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1047-metadata-guidelines-for-geospatial-data-resources-part-3[1]]
.

===== *1.2.1 Do you know your “Data Provider” from your “Data Publisher”*

Throughout this guide we refer to “Data Providers” and “Data
Publishers”. Within UK Location, the definition and distinction being
made between these two roles is very important.{nbsp} So what is the
difference?:

====== The Data Provider

The organisation that creates the data and supplies the data for web
publication, along with its metadata

====== The Data Publisher

The organisation that publishes the data on the web and supplies data
services to data users

If you as a Data Provider publish directly, then you will perform both
the roles of Data Provider and Data Publisher.

==== *[#1.3]####1.3 DMS Resources*

The latest versions of all the UK Location resources referred to in this
guide can be found via the UK Location Resource Centre:

https://data.gov.uk/[http://data.gov.uk/location]

==== *[#1.4]####1.4 Where to Obtain More Information*

The latest information, and additional resources, can be obtained by
visiting the{nbsp}UK Location{nbsp}web site.

=== [#Pub_Dis_Met]####2. Publishing Discovery Metadata

Data Providers publish their data and on-line services into UK Location
by creating and publishing discovery metadata. These resources are
registered with UK Location and made discoverable through its central
metadata catalogue, which forms part of the public data access portal,
data.gov.uk.

==== *[#2.1]####2.1 Requirements on Data Providers and Publishers*

Deciding to publish data into UK Location is a major commitment. INSPIRE
and UK Location is not a simple cataloguing service of what data exists
– it is a network of on-line services for that data and an operational
framework for future harmonisation and interoperability, such that it
can be more easily combined within a data user application, or used
directly through a range of on-line data services.

If you choose to publish, the following operational commitments apply:

* You will support data users in their evaluation and re-use of your
data, e.g. by using UK Location and INSPIRE community networking
services, such as those provided on the UK Location discovery portal,
data.gov.uk
* You will endeavour to adopt a process of continuous improvement for
the resources you publish, based on the feedback you receive, as this
will be beneficial to both data provider and user
* You
will{nbsp}https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1054-operational-guide#2.5[maintain
your discovery metadata]:
** assuring its quality against appropriate standards
** reviewing it and updating it regularly and ensuring it is updated
when new versions of data, data series or on-line services are published
(see Maintaining Discovery Metadata)
** maintaining metadata record FileIdentifers (UUID) throughout the life
of the metadata record (new UUIDs should only be created when new
resources are published, to prevent duplicate metadata records )
* You will release your data, data series and on-line services with
clear licensing and charging policies
* You will provide e-commerce services where charges apply for INSPIRE
data
* You will have clear procedures to make complaints received under data
access legislation, where appropriate
* You will agree to your data being viewable using data.gov.uk and other
evaluation clients, including the EU GeoPortal. If you require an
exemption from this requirement you should contact the UK Location
Coordination Unit

*The following service requirements apply*:

* For all data:
** compliance with the INSPIRE Metadata Regulation
[https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1047-metadata-guidelines-for-geospatial-data-resources-part-3[6]]
and the UK Location operational requirements as set out in this guide
** if publishing INSPIRE Network (on-line) Services, compliance with the
INSPIRE Network Services Regulation
[https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1047-metadata-guidelines-for-geospatial-data-resources-part-3[9]]
** the publishing of INSPIRE View Services for a given dataset or data
series
* For data that comes under an INSPIRE Theme and contains features
listed in the INSPIRE Data Specifications:
** legal compliance with the INSPIRE Directive
[https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1047-metadata-guidelines-for-geospatial-data-resources-part-3[8]]

==== *[#2.2]####2.2 Accountability*

Accountability for publishing data and associated resources rests with
you the Data Provider. If you are a Data Provider and are publishing
through a third party, they are responsible for providing a service to
you as the Data Provider, but they are not accountable for the data and
services published.{nbsp} Accountability at all times remains with you as
Data Provider, e.g. in relation to INSPIRE compliance and conformance to
INSPIRE and UK Location technical guidance.

==== *[#2.3]####2.3 Publishing Discovery Metadata for Data*

The process for publishing metadata records for data is shown as a
process model below.

This is highly generalised and you will need to view it in the context
of your own internal data management processes and integrate it into
this existing fabric.

image:https://www.agi.org.uk/images/xslt/Process_DataPublishing.jpg[Data
Metadata Publishing Process,width=960,height=720]

The creation and publishing of discovery metadata for a dataset or
series is triggered by the business decision (event) to publish the
data.

The Data Provider creates the discovery metadata for the dataset or
series, to the metadata requirements specified in this guide. The Data
Provider should then apply internal quality controls on this metadata,
before releasing it for publication.

Ideally, the metadata should be created by the part of the organisation
responsible for the data itself and based on metadata created at the
time the data was created, or updated.

The next stage of the process passes to the Data Publisher. This role
may be within the same organisation as the Data Provider, or a third
party acting on behalf of the Data Provider.{nbsp} Even if within the same
organisation, it is quite likely to be a different part of the
organisation, e.g. the data & knowledge management department, or within
the IT department.

The Data Publisher needs to update the metadata, creating the links to
any on-line resources associated with the data, e.g. data
specifications, licences and services. If these do not already exist,
then they may need to be created before the data can be published.

Once updated, the metadata needs to be passed through the Data
Publisher’s own internal quality controls. At this point the metadata
can be released for publication and registered with UK Location.

The final stage of the process passes to UK Location. At the point of
registration, the discovery metadata is collected automatically from the
Data Publisher, and subjected to a number of quality controls.{nbsp} Once
complete, the Data Publisher is notified of the results.{nbsp} If no errors
are recorded, the resource is added to the UK Location Catalogue and
becomes discoverable through the UK Location discovery service.{nbsp} If
errors are found, then the Data Publisher will need to correct these and
re-submit the resource.

==== *[#2.4]####2.4 Publishing Discovery Metadata for On-line Services*

The process for publishing metadata records for on-line services is
shown as a process model below.

This is highly generalised and you will need to view it in the context
of your own internal data publishing processes and integrate it into
this existing fabric.

image:https://www.agi.org.uk/images/xslt/Process_ServicePublishing.jpg[Service
Metadata Publishing Process,width=960,height=720]

The process is triggered by the creation of an on-line service for a
published dataset or series. This may be a new service, or the use of an
existing service, which has been extended to support the additional data
resource.{nbsp} If the former, a service metadata record will need to be
created.{nbsp} If the latter, than the existing service metadata record will
need to be revised to couple it to the new dataset or series.

Having created or revised the service metadata, then as with data
metadata records, it needs to be subject to internal quality controls
and release management.

Collection of the service metadata record is as for data, unless it is
an existing service, in which case it will be an update of the existing
registration.

==== *[#2.5]####2.5 Maintaining Discovery Metadata*

UK Location requires that Data Providers and their Data Publishers
maintain their published metadata records in line with the INSPIRE
Metadata Implementing Rule. This requires that the metadata elements and
the record itself are kept up to date. For example, if you decide to
change your published dataset, or move the location of a resource e.g.
view service, then you are responsible for ensuring that these changes
are updated in your metadata.

==== *[#2.6]####2.6 Data Sharing and Charging and Licensing*

Data sharing, including charging and licensing, 3rd party intellectual
property, and e-commerce issues are covered under separate UK Location
data sharing operational guidance. This is in the process of being
published.{nbsp} Please visit the UK Location Resource Centre for more
details.

=== [#Dis_Met_Req]####3. Discovery Metadata Requirements

UK Location discovery metadata will be used by potential data users to
discover and evaluate published location information for use in a range
of applications. To enable the data user to do this, they require
comprehensive information about the data and services.{nbsp} The better the
discovery metadata, the more likely the data will be shared and re-used
in an appropriate way.

GEMINI 2.3 has been updated so that UK Location discovery no longer
needs an application profile.

*Considerable care needs to be taken over the creation of discovery
metadata. It is strongly recommended that you use a metadata editor
tool, that fully supports the encoding requirements defined in
[https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1047-metadata-guidelines-for-geospatial-data-resources-part-3[28]]
and uses the UK Location XSD and Schematron schemas
[https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1047-metadata-guidelines-for-geospatial-data-resources-part-3[28,30]],
to ensure that your metadata is fully compliant with UKL and INSPIRE
requirements.*

GEMINI 2.3 metadata is encoded in XML, as described in
the{nbsp}https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1048-uk-gemini-encoding-guidance[encoding
guidance{nbsp}]{nbsp}and a Schematron ruled-based validation Schema
[https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1047-metadata-guidelines-for-geospatial-data-resources-part-3[30]]
can be used to check these XML instances.

For a detailed explanation of each element, please refer to
the{nbsp}https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1037-uk-gemini-standard-and-inspire-implementing-rules[UK
GEMINI2 standard{nbsp}]and associated guidance. For metadata describing data
(datasets and services),

==== [#3.1]####3.1 Elements of importance to the DMS

Some metadata elements are particularly important to the operation of
the DMS, rather than to the users of the DMS.

===== 3.1.1 Metadata record File Identifier

To support the operation of UK Location and INSPIRE, discovery metadata
records must include a File Identifier for the resource. The file
identifier is the unique persistant identifier of the metadata record;
it must not change when the record is updated.

===== 3.1.2 Metadata date

This must be updated when ever the metadata record is edited.
Data.gov.uk harvesting will only collect the new record if the Metadata
date is more recent than the old one.

===== [#data_servce_linking]####3.1.3 Data and Service Linking

UK Location and INSPIRE is a network of distributed on-line services
that provide access to published location information. To provide this
access, the discovery metadata about the data needs to tell the data
user what services are available and how to access them, in a
machine-readable way.{nbsp} This is achieved using the discovery metadata
element “Resource Locator”.

*For the network to operate, it is critical that these links are
correct:*

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|===
|Data Metadata a|
The Resource Locator must define the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for
the on-line services that provide access to it.

As well as the URL, it is also necessary to provide distribution format
information in all cases.

If the format and version are known, then they should be given.

If no on-line services are available for access, then you should enter
the URL for further information about access.

|Service Metadata |Depending on the nature of the on-line service,
machine-readable or human readable, one of two URLs should be provided -
one giving the URL of an OGC web service ‘GetCapabilities request’,
e.g.service=WMS&amp;request=GetCapabilities&amp;, or the location of
further information about a service.
|===

==== *[#3.2]####3.2 Data Provider Licence information*

The following Data Provider licensing information must be provided:

* Include a Licence Title within the free text field 'Use Constraints',
and where possible a Licence URL as an ‘anchor’ reference.
* If more than one type of licence is included in the dataset then the
URL should point to a Data Providers page, explaining this and linking
to these licenses.

Upon collection, UK Location will record the Use Constraints text and
URL in the 'licence' field displayed on data.gov.uk. The UK Government
encourages public bodies to release data explicitly under an open
licence, which on data.gov.uk currently includes the "Open Government
Licence" and the "OS OpenData Licence". For data.gov.uk to correctly
categorise your data as open, ensure these licence titles are stated in
the Use Constraints text field exactly as quoted here, for example “Open
Government Licence”.

==== *[#3.3]####3.3 Metadata Encoding*

UK Location discovery metadata records must be published as an
Extensible Markup Language (XML) document. This must follow
the{nbsp}https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1048-uk-gemini-encoding-guidance[UK
Location UK GEMINI Encoding
Guidance]{nbsp}[https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1047-metadata-guidelines-for-geospatial-data-resources-part-3[28]].

==== *[#3.4]####3.4 Metadata Validation*

Published discovery metadata XML document resources will be validated in
a three stage process, using:

* The ISO XML schemas
* The UK Location variant of the ISO Schematron rules
* A{nbsp}UK Location GEMINI Schematron schema
[https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1047-metadata-guidelines-for-geospatial-data-resources-part-3[30]]

Data Publishers are required to validate their metadata records using
these before resource registration. UK Location has published guidance
on using its Schematron rules
[https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1047-metadata-guidelines-for-geospatial-data-resources-part-3[29]].

==== *[#3.5]####3.5 Community Extensions to UK GEMINI2*

Within a given organisation or thematic community, there may be the need
to record additional items of metadata to meet local requirements.
Existing examples include Marine Environmental Data and Information
Network (MEDIN) and Academic Geospatial Metadata Application Profile
(AGMAP).

UK Location will accept additional metadata elements within a metadata
record XML document. These elements must be taken from ISO 19115 and be
encoded in conformance with ISO 19139.

==== *[#3.7]####3.6 Extension to Code Lists*

UK GEMINI2 includes a number of code lists taken from ISO 19115. Within
a given organisation or thematic community, you may wish to extend these
code lists. {nbsp}These extensions need to be incorporated into the INSPIRE
and/or UK Location specified code lists before they can be used.{nbsp} If you
wish to extend a code list for an INSPIRE metadata element, please
contact the UK Location Coordination Unit.

==== *[#3.7]####3.7 Local Guidance*

The type of data being published will have a strong bearing on the
content of the metadata created. It is strongly recommended that data
providers create local guidance, based on UK GEMINI2 and this
operational guide.

=== [#Pub_Dis_Met_rec]####4. Publishing Discovery Metadata records

Publishing discovery metadata for UK Location for data and services is a
three stage process:

. *Publish discovery metadata records*{nbsp}to a harvest location, from which
the resources can be machine-accessed from the Internet
. *Register your harvest location*{nbsp}with data.gov.uk.
. *Collection*. Sometimes known as ‘harvesting’, this is where
data.gov.uk collects the metadata records from the registered location,
makes them available within data.gov.uk, and for further collection on
to Europe.

==== *[#4.1]####4.1 Publishing Discovery Metadata records*

This involves transferring your completed discovery metadata records to
an on-line location, which can be machine accessed through the Internet.
The records must be accessible using one of two mechanisms:

* OGC Catalogue Service for the Web (CSW),{nbsp}_or_
* Web Accessible Folder (WAF)

These mechanisms will be used by the Discovery Metadata Service, to
collect registered discovery metadata records. For more information
about this interface, please refer to the DMS Collection Interface
Specification
[https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1047-metadata-guidelines-for-geospatial-data-resources-part-3[26]].

===== 4.1.1 Discovery Metadata Harvest location

This can take a number of forms. It may be local to your business unit,
or organisation, or a community resource, shared across a number of
organisations.

The most important aspect of the harvest location is that it holds the
published{nbsp}*MASTER*{nbsp}of the resources being published, i.e. it is your
control point for their publication to UK Location and that it is the
endpoint for services and their Coupled Resources.

If publishing elsewhere, e.g. to thematic or regional catalogues and
information portals, you should consider using this same control point –
applying the ‘publish only once principle’.

====== *_Record Organisation_*

How you organise your records will be subject to your own local needs
and practices. Possible catalogue/file directory structures include:

* By business unit
* By theme
* By data and services and/or
* By Data Provider (if shared)

You can reflect this structure when you register harvest locations with
UK Location, i.e. you can register all of the resources under a
particular business unit or theme, and apply a filter against the rest
of the contents.

The only mandatory structure to apply is if the location contains
resources associated with more than one Data Provider. These need to be
registered separately, so your harvest location must be structured such
that these can be identified as a group.

*Please note that initially the above will only be supported if using
WAF as your publishing mechanism. If using CSW, then the specified URL
must contain only files for publication to UK Location, published under
a single registration, relating to a single Data Provider.*

*Subject to demand, CSW filtering will be introduced as part of a later
release.*

If you have an immediate requirement for UK Location to support CSW
Filtering, by category or element, please contact the UK Location
Coordination Unit, using the contact form at:{nbsp}https://defra.gov.uk/.

==== *[#4.2]####4.2 Registering the harvest location*

UK Location discovery metadata records are registered using the UK
Government data publishing and discovery
portal{nbsp}http://data.gov.uk/[data.gov.uk].

Data.gov.uk is a single point of registration, discovery and access for
a range of data, not purely location information. It provides two
channels for registering discovery metadata.

Data and services published through UK Location must be registered using
the dedicated data.gov.uk channel –{nbsp}*Collection{nbsp}*(discovery metadata).

The end-to-end process for publishing UK Location discovery metadata
records for data and services, using data.gov.uk, is shown below.

image:https://www.agi.org.uk/images/xslt/RegisterDiscoveryMetadata.jpg[Register
Discovery Metadata Records,width=960,height=720]

===== 4.2.1 Data.gov.uk Publisher Accounts

Data and services are published against a registered organisation, e.g.
government department or agency. This is the organisation{nbsp}*legally
accountable*{nbsp}for the data being published -{nbsp}*the UK Location “Data
Provider”.*

*Please note that within data.gov.uk, the Data Provider is referred to
as the “Publisher” for metadata and data resources, irrespective of
whether they are publishing directly, or indirectly through a third
party.*

The registration of data.gov.uk “Publishers” is through a process of
‘request and approval’. The process is explained within the “Data” tab
of data.gov.uk

If publishing directly, you will need to determine if a data.gov.uk
Publisher account already exists for your organisation (this is clear
within the online application process).

You can then either apply for{nbsp}*_editor access_*{nbsp}(which lets you register
and administer published data resources) or{nbsp}*_administrator
access,_*{nbsp}which gives you the same powers as{nbsp}_editor access_{nbsp}but also
lets you edit publisher’s details (including name, description, and
contact information), and authorize access for other users to be editor
or administrator for the organisation.

====== *_Special Guidance for Third Party Publishers_*

If you are a third party Data Publisher, i.e. publishing on behalf of a
Data Provider, you will need to adopt a different approach for data and
services. For data, discovery metadata records must be published under
the Data Provider’s name.{nbsp} For Services, these must be published under
your Data Publisher’s name.

You will need to ensure that you have formal approval to publish from
your Data Provider. This will be checked by The National Archives before
approval is given.

====== *_Signing up for{nbsp}__data.gov.uk accounts_*

Before you can publish data and services on data.gov.uk, you will need
to sign up and associate yourself with one or more Publishers.

For further information, see the data.gov.uk User Guide
[https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1047-metadata-guidelines-for-geospatial-data-resources-part-3[31]]

====== *_Creating a Publisher_*

If there is not an existing data.gov.uk Publisher for the UK Location
Data Provider, you will need to contact the Cabinet Office data.gov.uk
team to request the addition of your publisher:
http://data.gov.uk/publisher/apply/cabinet-office

====== *_Publisher Administrators and Editors_*

Publishers are associated with two tiers of user:

* *Administrators*, with profile edit and publishing rights, e.g. the
ability to change the published details for the organization and add
editors
* *Editors*, with publishing rights only

Typically, a Publisher will only have one Administrator, although
additional Administrators may be added, e.g. to provide cover, or
temporarily to facilitate a hand-over.

But, a Publisher may have a number of Editors, i.e. users with
responsibility for publishing different datasets associated with
different parts of the organisation.

Please note that Administrators and Editors can see and edit ALL
resources associated with a Publisher, not just their own.

The addition of Administrators and Editors can only be done by the
account Administrators; you can request this via the data.gov.uk site,
or by contacting the account administrator directly.

===== 4.2.2 Registering Metadata Harvesting Resources

Having created an account on data.gov.uk and gained editor rights to the
relevant Publisher, you are now in a position to register metadata
harvesting resources, for that Publisher.

To register a metadata harvesting resource, select [Dataset Harvesting]
from the Publisher tools sub-menu, which appears on the “Data” tab.

Select [Add a harvesting resource]. Using the displayed form, enter:

* Collection Interface Type – indicating whether the source is a CSW, a
single document, or WAF
* Source – the root URL of the CSW or WAF, e.g.
http://www.someserver.com/csw/csw.cgi or
http://www.example.org/metadata.
* Description – an optional free text field for recording any relevant
details about the registration. Use this to help you manage your
Registrations and is not displayed publically on data.gov.uk
* Select the relevant Publisher (Data Provider) from the drop down list.
* Leave the State set to active
* Click “Save”

The registration will establish a collection task, which will collect
the discovery metadata records located from the specified URL.

It should be noted that in time, this same mechanism will be used to
publish other resources, associated with a given Publisher, e.g.
machine-readable Licences. It is also the intention to extend the
functionality to support:

* CSW Filtering
* Scheduled Collection (automatic refresh of discovery metadata records
at an interval specified by the Data Publisher
* Response handling – automatic forwarding of error messages to an
address specified by the Data Publisher, e.g. to a central error log

==== *[#4.3]####4.3 Collection*

The collection task created as described above is only run when
requested, that is, when you click the ‘Refresh’ button for that harvest
source, which is on the list of harvesting sources visible to the
administrators of the publisher.

===== 4.3.1 Validation

Once collected, the individual data and service discovery metadata
records will be subject to the following validation checks:

* XSD validation of XML document
* Schematron Schema validation of XML document
* Data Provider validation against registered “Publisher” details on
data.gov.uk
* URL validation (http response)

If the validation is successful, the metadata record will be visible
within data.gov.uk, and will also be passed on to the Catalogue
Publishing Service (data.gov.uk’s OGC CSW interface), from which it will
be collected by the{nbsp}http://inspire-geoportal.ec.europa.eu/[European
INSPIRE GeoPortal].

In the event of an error being found, an error message will be returned
to the Discovery Metadata status panel. Those that pass validation, will
be added to the data.gov.uk metadata catalogue and the XML documents
stored for subsequent use. Resources will take approximately 30 minutes
to appear on data.gov.uk once successfully collected.

===== 4.3.2 Error Handling

If, having harvested from a metadata resource, the collection task
fails, errors will be returned to the Discovery Metadata status panel.
Potential errors include:

* HTTP time outs, that may suggest the CSW is ‘down’ or the Web
Accessible Folder cannot be accessed
* CSW error responses
* Validation errors

INSPIRE carries out its own validation. At present, it does not reject
any records. A searchable collection of validation reports is available
at{nbsp}http://inspire-geoportal.ec.europa.eu/proxybrowser/ProxyBrowser/;
this includes validation reports on metadata records, services, and
layers within services.

===== 4.3.3 Maintaining Registered Discovery Metadata records

To maintain previous discovery metadata registrations, first select
[Data] then [Dataset Harvesting] from the Publisher tools sub-menu.

From this list of harvesting sources, you can

* Edit the URL, source type, description or status of a harvesting
source
* View the status, including errors during the last harvest
* Refresh, i.e. request that the source be harvested again soon. We may
add a refresh scheduling option to the service in the future. If you
have an immediate requirement for this please contact the UK Location
Coordination Unit, using the contact form
at:{nbsp}http://location.defra.gov.uk/resources/contact-us/.
* A “refresh” harvest will collect new and updated metadata records from
the source. An updated record is one with the same file identifier, but
a more recent metadata date.

====== *_Withdrawing Discovery Metadata records_*

Once a discovery metadata record has been registered, the record should
not be removed from the source location. If, in exceptional cases, you
need to withdraw a metadata record:

* Remove the record from your harvesting source
* Login to{nbsp}www.data.gov.uk/data{nbsp}using a username (account) that has
administrator permissions for that metadata record;
* Click on the metadata page for the metadata record you wish to
“Withdraw”;
* Check you are withdrawing the FAULTY version (for example
OLDER/out-of-date data) of the two duplicate datasets (you could check
the “Date updated” and the “Harvest Date” to find most recent version) ;
* Note that the Unique identifier for your metadata record is the file
identifier, for example:{nbsp}{nbsp} 661856f3-e718-4c37-93ff-f0860bb28e52
* On the right-hand side under heading “Withdrawal” click on “Withdraw
this dataset” (all UK Location metadata records are known as ‘datasets’
on data.gov.uk);
* Click on the “Cancel” button if you are not sure, or click on the “OK”
button if this is the metadata record you need to “Withdraw”
* You should see a message highlighted in red to confirm this metadata
record has been withdrawn, and you will not now be able to find this
metadata record in a{nbsp}http://www.gov.uk/[www.gov.uk]{nbsp}text keyword search.

Remember to ensure that you fix any links between metadata records. That
is, if you withdraw a{nbsp}*service record*, check that no dataset records
still point to it, e.g. by Resource locator. If you withdraw a{nbsp}*dataset
record*, check that no series or service records still point to it, e.g.
by Coupled resource,

This will then be promulgated to the Catalogue Publishing Service
(data.gov.uk CSW interface) within a few hours, and from there should
result in the record being removed from the European INSPIRE GeoPortal.

If you would like advice, please email both the metadata record’s URL
weblink and the unique Harvest GUID for the metadata record that you
would like to withdraw, and email to the UK Location
Helpdesk:{nbsp}[#cloak8b865acef497806498058eabbfa4f7da]#UKLocation.Helpdesk@defra.gsi.gov.uk#

====== *_Reinstating a withdrawn record_*

This should be an even rarer exception. If your harvest source contains
a metadata record with the same file identifier as has been used before,
but with a more recent metadata date, then when that record is
harvested, it will be re-instated at data.gov.uk, and from there will
appear in the Catalogue Publishing Service and the INSPIRE GeoPortal.

=== [#Met_Pub_Tec]####5. Metadata Publishing and Technology Choices

There are a number of technical solution options that will help you
create UK Location discovery metadata records and publish them to UK
Location. These can cover some or all of the following elements of a
metadata record creation and publishing environment:

* Discovery metadata record creation
* Change control and release management
* Publishing (exposing discovery metadata records to a harvestable
Internet endpoint)

These options are outlined below. Using the information provided here,
it is recommended that you then discuss your specific requirements with
your IT department and/or system supplier.

==== *[#5.1]####5.1 UK Location Metadata Editor*

UK Location includes its own Metadata Editor that can be used by Data
Providers and Publishers to create compliant discovery metadata records.

The Editor is a web browser application, based on the open source
product Geonetwork. It is available both as an on-line service and as a
downloadable configuration package for use as part of a local
server-based installation of Geonetwork.

For more information, to register for the on-line service or to download
the configuration package, please visit the UK Location Resource Centre.

==== *[#5.2]####5.2 Geonetwork Publishing Solution*

The use of Geonetwork as the basis for the UK Location Metadata Editor
provides the option for Data Providers and Publishers to extend a local
instance of the editor to provide cataloguing, change and release
management and publishing (using CSW) services. This is all
out-of-the-box Geonetwork functionality.{nbsp} In addition, there are other
open source products that enable you to integrate Geonetwork with your
existing GIS and build a full data publishing environment, supporting
the delivery of on-line services, e.g. View (WMS) and Download (WFS)
services.

For more information on Geonetwork and links to other open source Geoweb
products, please
visit:{nbsp}http://geonetwork-opensource.org/[http://geonetwork-opensource.org]

==== *[#5.3]####5.3 Third Party Solutions*

Most of the providers of Geospatial Information Systems provide metadata
creation and publishing tools as part of their solution packages.

UK Location have created a number of resources to help solution
providers integrate the support for UK Location discovery metadata
creation and publishing into these existing packages:

* https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1048-uk-gemini-encoding-guidance[UK
GEMINI Encoding Guidance]
* http://data.gov.uk/library/uk-gemini-schematron-schema-technical-guidance[UK
GEMINI Schematron Schema and Guidance]
* http://data.gov.uk/sites/default/files/DMS_Collection_Interface_Specification_10.pdf[UK
Location Collection Interface Specification]

All these resources are available through the UK Location Resource
Centre. We would recommend that you speak to your system supplier to
determine the support they can provide and to discuss how this can be
best integrated into your existing systems.
