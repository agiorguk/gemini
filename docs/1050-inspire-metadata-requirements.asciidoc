= INSPIRE Metadata Requirements
include::./includes/attributes.asciidoc[]

The INSPIRE Implementing Rules for Metadata requires that a set of
metadata elements shall be provided. These are grouped in the following
categories:

. Identification
. Classification of spatial and data services
. Keyword
. Geographic location
. Temporal reference
. Quality and validity
. Conformity
. Constraint related to access and use
. Organisations responsible for the establishment, management,
maintenance and distribution of the resource
. Metadata on metadata

These are realized as a set of elements shown below. These may be
implemented in various ways including ISO 19115 and Dublin Core. UK
GEMINI is an ISO 19115 implementation.
