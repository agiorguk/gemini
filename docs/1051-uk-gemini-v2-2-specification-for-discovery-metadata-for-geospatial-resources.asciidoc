== Foreword

UK GEMINI was originally produced in 2004 by collaboration between the
Association for Geographic Information (AGI), the (then) e-Government
Unit (eGU) and the UK Data Archive. It was designed for use in the UK
geospatial metadata service{nbsp} _gigateway_{nbsp}to replace the NGDF (National
Geospatial Data Framework) metadata standard with metadata that is
compatible with ISO 19115.

In 2006, a Working Group was set up under the auspices of The
Association for Geographic Information (AGI) to revise UK GEMINI. It
contained representatives from the following organisations:

* AGI
* British Geological Survey
* Cabinet Office
* EDINA
* Environment Agency
* gigateway
* Natural England
* Ordnance Survey
* UK Hydrographic Office

The principles of the revision were as follows:

. to meet the requirements for metadata of the EU INSPIRE Directive –
where an element is mandatory in the INSPIRE Implementing Rules, it is
included in UK GEMINI with the same domain and occurrence, but the
element name and description may be different in order to maintain
compatibility with the previous version of GEMINI and to provide greater
clarity;
. to be conformant with the International Standard ISO 19115 Geographic
information – Metadata, within the limits of the requirements of
INSPIRE;
. to be consistent with the GEMINI 1.0 where possible;
. to be compatible with the e-Government Metadata Standard where
possible;
. to correct errors in GEMINI 1.0 and take into account experience of
its use.

Further changes were made in version 2.1 in 2010, in the light of
experience of use of UK GEMINI2, and changes to the INSPIRE Technical
Guidelines.

UK GEMINI 2.2 included further changes requested by the UK Location
Programme Metadata Working Group.

In 2018, changes were made that had been requested by various user
communities as well as the revised metadata technical guidance from
INSPIRE. This updated version is known as UK GEMINI2.3.

Further details of all these changes are
given link:1055-uk-gemini-major-changes-since-1-0[here].

A set of guidelines for metadata for geospatial datasets was originally
produced in 2006. The Guidelines were in three parts:

* Part 1 Introduction to Metadata
* Part 2 Creating metadata using UK GEMINI
* Part 3 Metadata quality

These Guidelines were intended for general use in the UK geographic
information environment, and particularly in support of the national
geospatial metadata service, _gigateway_. They were developed within the
context of a national geospatial metadata service, and UK GEMINI. These
Guidelines have now been updated to incorporate the changes made in the
revised version of UK GEMINI, 2.3, and their content made available on
the AGI website: link:1052-metadata-guidelines-for-geospatial-data-resources-part-1[Introduction to Metadata]; 
parts of link:1049-metadata-guidelines-for-geospatial-data-resources-part-2[Creating metadata using GEMINI]; 
material in Part 2 which was specific to particular elements has been moved to the element descriptions.

This Standard is maintained by the AGI Standards Committee. Any feedback
on it should be sent to mailto:standards@agi.org.uk[gemini@agi.org.uk]

== Introduction

Geospatial data is data containing a locational element relative to the
Earth. Many datasets that at first sight do not appear to be geospatial
nevertheless do have a geospatial component, in that they apply to a
limited geographic area, for example statistics for a local authority
area. Geospatial data contains spatial references which may take the
form of coordinates, for example in latitude and longitude, or
references to geographic names, for example street data.

Metadata is data about data. It provides additional information about a
data resource, to enable the data resource to be better understood and
used to good effect. There are a range of uses for metadata:

* *discovery*: the user aims to find out what available data resources
are potentially able to satisfy a specified set of requirements.
* *evaluation*: the user needs to go deeper in the metadata (e.g.
looking at the quality information) in order to ascertain whether a
candidate data resource is fit for the intended purpose.
* *use*: the user has selected a candidate data resource, but needs to
access it and to configure a system or software to process it.

There are many metadata standards in existence. These have been produced
at different times by different bodies for different purposes. The main
one that is relevant to geospatial datasets is:

* *ISO 19115*, the International Standard which describes all aspects
of geospatial metadata and provides a comprehensive set of metadata
elements that are widely used as the basis for geospatial metadata
services.

The https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/about-inspire/563[EU INSPIRE Directive] mandates
the collection of metadata for use in Europe. Implementing Rules define
the requirements for metadata for discovery purposes. These are based on
ISO 19115.

The aim of UK GEMINI is to provide a core set of metadata elements for
use in a UK geospatial metadata service, that are compatible with the
INSPIRE requirements for metadata. It does not preclude organisations
recording additional metadata elements for their own internal business
purposes.

In this document the term ‘data resource’ is used, in preference to
‘dataset’. This is to allow UK GEMINI to be applied to resources in
addition to datasets, such as services supplying data.

== Scope

This Standard specifies a set of metadata elements for describing
geographic information resources. These resources may be datasets,
dataset series, services delivering geographic data, or any other
information resource with a geospatial content. This includes datasets
that relate to a limited geographic area.
The data resources may be graphical or textual (tabular or free text),
hardcopy or digital.

The metadata elements are intended for use in a metadata service for
discovering what data resources exist. The elements include the
mandatory core set defined in ISO 19115 Geographic information – Metadata,
and comply with the https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/metadata/6541[INSPIRE Implementing Rules for Metadata].
In any implementation or community, it is likely that additional
metadata elements will be included for other purposes, such as data
management, and a method for specifying such elements is defined. The UK
specific guidance is designed to ensure that the metadata records work
correctly with the national
catalogue, https://data.gov.uk/[https://data.gov.uk]

Guidance on transferring metadata records to the national catalogue are
given
at link:1054-operational-guide[Operational Guide].

This Standard is applicable to data creators, data owners, data
publishers and suppliers of metadata services. Although it is primarily
designed for data resources held within the UK on a national basis, by
following the principles and structures of ISO 19115, it is also
applicable within an organisation, user community or nation.

== Requirements

=== Datasets and dataset series

UK GEMINI specifies a set of metadata elements for use when describing
geographic information resources.

The metadata elements are listed in
the link:1250-element-summary[summary table], which shows the metadata element names, their GEMINI element id
(consistent with element numbers in previous versions of GEMINI), the
obligation (whether their inclusion is mandatory, optional or
conditional, and the number of possible occurrences of the element
(whether there may be many (N), or only one (1)), and whether the
element is available for both data and services.

Some metadata elements concern the metadata rather than the data
resource itself. These are termed ‘metadata on metadata’. These elements
are likely to have common values for a set of metadata records provided
by an organisation.

For metadata to conform to this Standard, it is necessary that all
mandatory elements are provided, and that all conditional elements are
provided when the stated condition is met. Optional elements should be
provided where they are applicable.

=== Services

The INSPIRE Implementing Rules apply not only to datasets and datasets
series, but also to (data) services. These are external applications
(e.g. web services) that deliver data to a user or process, rather than
complete datasets. For such services, some additional metadata elements
are required. These additional elements are Spatial data service type
and Coupled resource.

Note that services are not described in ISO 19115, but in ISO 19119
(with an associated amendment). This results in a slight inconsistency
of approach regarding the way that metadata is recorded for services.
Some of the other metadata elements may not apply to particular types of
service. The UK GEMINI metadata elements for services are identified in
the link:1250-element-summary[summary table].

=== Element details

Details of the metadata elements are given in :

link:1062-gemini-datasets-and-data-series.html[GEMINI - Datasets and dataset series]

link:1063-gemini-services.html[GEMINI - Services]


Each element listed separately, with the following information:

-*Metadata element name* – the name of the UK GEMINI element;

- *UK GEMINI id* – the identifier of the UK GEMINI element; note: these
do not change between versions of GEMINI; ids of deleted elements are
not re-used.

- *Definition* – the formal definition of the element;

- *Purpose and meaning* - an explanation of what the element is, and why
it is required

- *Obligation* – whether the element is mandatory, optional or
conditional (where the element must be supplied when stated conditions
apply);

- *Occurrence* – whether the element is single-valued or can have
multiple values;

- *Data type* – the form of the entry, whether it is a character string
(CharacterString), real number (real), integer, code or other class.
Where the data type is another class, it is described as a set of
sub-elements. Examples are Distributor and Vertical extent;

- *Domain* – the allowable set of values;

- *Guidance* – advice on how to complete the entry

- *Comment* – other other information of relevance;

- *Examples*

- *Corresponding element* in INSPIRE Metadata, ISO 19115:2003, ISO
19139:2007

- *Change history* – how the element has changed from v1.0 of the
Standard;

- *Encoding guidelines & example* - how to create an XML instance of
this element

- *Errors observed* - observations on errors noted with each element
