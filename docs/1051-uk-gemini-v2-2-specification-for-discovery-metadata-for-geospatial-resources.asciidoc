=== Foreword

UK GEMINI was originally produced in 2004 by collaboration between the
Association for Geographic Information (AGI), the (then) e-Government
Unit (eGU) and the UK Data Archive. It was designed for use in the UK
geospatial metadata service{nbsp} _gigateway_{nbsp}to replace the NGDF (National
Geospatial Data Framework) metadata standard with metadata that is
compatible with ISO 19115.

In 2006, a Working Group was set up under the auspices of The
Association for Geographic Information (AGI) to revise UK GEMINI. It
contained representatives from the following organisations:

* AGI
* British Geological Survey
* Cabinet Office
* EDINA
* Environment Agency
* gigateway
* Natural England
* Ordnance Survey
* UK Hydrographic Office

The principles of the revision were as follows:

. to meet the requirements for metadata of the EU INSPIRE Directive –
where an element is mandatory in the INSPIRE Implementing Rules, it is
included in UK GEMINI with the same domain and occurrence, but the
element name and description may be different in order to maintain
compatibility with the previous version of GEMINI and to provide greater
clarity;
. to be conformant with the International Standard ISO 19115 Geographic
information – Metadata, within the limits of the requirements of
INSPIRE;
. to be consistent with the GEMINI 1.0 where possible;
. to be compatible with the e-Government Metadata Standard where
possible;
. to correct errors in GEMINI 1.0 and take into account experience of
its use.

Further changes were made in version 2.1 in 2010, in the light of
experience of use of UK GEMINI2, and changes to the INSPIRE Technical
Guidelines.

UK GEMINI 2.2 included further changes requested by the UK Location
Programme Metadata Working Group.

In 2018, changes were made that had been requested by various user
communities as well as the revised metadata technical guidance from
INSPIRE. {nbsp}This updated version is known as UK GEMINI2.3.

Further details of all these changes are
given{nbsp}https://www.agi.org.uk/40-gemini/1055-uk-gemini-major-changes-since-1-0[here].

A set of guidelines for metadata for geospatial datasets was originally
produced in 2006. The Guidelines were in three parts:

* Part 1 Introduction to Metadata
* Part 2 Creating metadata using UK GEMINI
* Part 3 Metadata quality

These Guidelines were intended for general use in the UK geographic
information environment, and particularly in support of the national
geospatial metadata service,{nbsp}_gigateway_. They were developed within the
context of a national geospatial metadata service, and UK GEMINI. These
Guidelines have now been updated to incorporate the changes made in the
revised version of UK GEMINI, 2.3, and their content made available on
the AGI
website:{nbsp}https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1052-metadata-guidelines-for-geospatial-data-resources-part-1[Introduction
to Metadata]; parts
of{nbsp}https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1049-metadata-guidelines-for-geospatial-data-resources-part-2[Creating
metadata using GEMINI]; material in Part 2 which was specific to
particular elements has been moved to the element descriptions.

This Standard is maintained by the AGI Standards Committee. Any feedback
on it should be sent
to{nbsp}mailto:standards@agi.org.uk[gemini@agi.org.uk]

=== [#Intro]####Introduction

Geospatial data is data containing a locational element relative to the
Earth. Many datasets that at first sight do not appear to be geospatial
nevertheless do have a geospatial component, in that they apply to a
limited geographic area, for example statistics for a local authority
area. Geospatial data contains spatial references which may take the
form of coordinates, for example in latitude and longitude, or
references to geographic names, for example street data.

Metadata is data about data. It provides additional information about a
data resource, to enable the data resource to be better understood and
used to good effect. There are a range of uses for metadata:

* *discovery*: the user aims to find out what available data resources
are potentially able to satisfy a specified set of requirements.
* *evaluation*: the user needs to go deeper in the metadata (e.g.
looking at the quality information) in order to ascertain whether a
candidate data resource is fit for the intended purpose.
* *use*: the user has selected a candidate data resource, but needs to
access it and to configure a system or software to process it.

There are many metadata standards in existence. These have been produced
at different times by different bodies for different purposes. The main
one that is relevant to geospatial datasets is:

* **ISO 19115,{nbsp}**the International Standard which describes all aspects
of geospatial metadata and provides a comprehensive set of metadata
elements that are widely used as the basis for geospatial metadata
services.

The{nbsp}https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/about-inspire/563[EU INSPIRE
Directive]{nbsp}[https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1047-metadata-guidelines-for-geospatial-data-resources-part-3[7]]{nbsp}mandates
the collection of metadata for use in Europe. Implementing Rules define
the requirements for metadata for discovery purposes. These are based on
ISO 19115, and
outlined{nbsp}https://www.agi.org.uk/40-gemini/1055-uk-gemini-major-changes-since-1-0[here].

The aim of UK GEMINI is to provide a core set of metadata elements for
use in a UK geospatial metadata service, that are compatible with the
INSPIRE requirements for metadata. It does not preclude organisations
recording additional metadata elements for their own internal business
purposes.

In this document the term ‘data resource’ is used, in preference to
‘dataset’. This is to allow UK GEMINI to be applied to resources in
addition to datasets, such as services supplying data.

=== [#scope]##{nbsp}1. Scope

This Standard specifies a set of metadata elements for describing
geographic information resources. These resources may be datasets,
dataset series, services delivering geographic data, or any other
information resource with a geospatial content. This includes datasets
that relate to a limited geographic area
[https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1047-metadata-guidelines-for-geospatial-data-resources-part-3[1]].
The data resources may be graphical or textual (tabular or free text),
hardcopy or digital.

The metadata elements are intended for use in a metadata service for
discovering what data resources exist. The elements include the
mandatory core set defined in ISO 19115 Geographic information –
Metadata, and comply with
the{nbsp}https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/metadata/6541[INSPIRE Implementing
Rules for
Metadata]{nbsp}[https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1047-metadata-guidelines-for-geospatial-data-resources-part-3[7]].
In any implementation or community, it is likely that additional
metadata elements will be included for other purposes, such as data
management, and a method for specifying such elements is defined. The UK
specific guidance is designed to ensure that the metadata records work
correctly with the national
catalogue,{nbsp}https://data.gov.uk/[https://data.gov.uk]

Guidance on transferring metadata records to the national catalogue are
given
at{nbsp}https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1054-operational-guide[Operational
Guide].

This Standard is applicable to data creators, data owners, data
publishers and suppliers of metadata services. Although it is primarily
designed for data resources held within the UK on a national basis, by
following the principles and structures of ISO 19115, it is also
applicable within an organisation, user community or nation.

==== *_[#4.1]####4.1 Datasets and dataset series_*

UK GEMINI specifies a set of metadata elements for use when describing
geographic information resources.

The metadata elements are listed in
the{nbsp}https://www.agi.org.uk/40-gemini/1055-uk-gemini-major-changes-since-1-0[summary
table], which shows the metadata element names, their GEMINI element id
(consistent with element numbers in previous versions of GEMINI), the
obligation (whether their inclusion is mandatory, optional or
conditional, and the number of possible occurrences of the element
(whether there may be many (N), or only one (1)), and whether the
element is available for both data and services.

Some metadata elements concern the metadata rather than the data
resource itself. These are termed ‘metadata on metadata’. These elements
are likely to have common values for a set of metadata records provided
by an organisation.

For metadata to conform to this Standard, it is necessary that all
mandatory elements are provided, and that all conditional elements are
provided when the stated condition is met. Optional elements should be
provided where they are applicable. A checklist for conformity is
given{nbsp}https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1040-checklist-for-conformity2[here].

==== {nbsp}*_[#4.2]####4.2 Services_*

The INSPIRE Implementing Rules apply not only to datasets and datasets
series, but also to (data) services. These are external applications
(e.g. web services) that deliver data to a user or process, rather than
complete datasets. For such services, some additional metadata elements
are required. These additional elements are Spatial data service type
and Coupled resource.

Note that services are not described in ISO 19115, but in ISO 19119
(with an associated amendment). This results in a slight inconsistency
of approach regarding the way that metadata is recorded for services.
Some of the other metadata elements may not apply to particular types of
service. The UK GEMINI metadata elements for services are identified in
the{nbsp}https://www.agi.org.uk/40-gemini/1055-uk-gemini-major-changes-since-1-0[summary
table].

==== *_[#4.3]####4.3 Element details_*

Details of the metadata elements are given in :

=== [#extended]##{nbsp}5. Extended metadata

==== *_[#5.1]####5.1 Additional metadata elements_*

In many organisations, there is a need to record additional items of
metadata to meet specific local requirements. This may be to incorporate
particular characteristics of the data resources, or for particular
applications. Additional metadata elements may be included in a metadata
implementation. These elements should be taken from ISO 19115
[https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1047-metadata-guidelines-for-geospatial-data-resources-part-3[18]],
which includes a comprehensive collection of metadata elements for
geographic information, and also allows for further extensions.

==== *_[#5.2]####5.2 Extension of code lists_*

Several metadata elements specified in UK GEMINI use enumerated code
lists. These are pre-defined sets of values identified by codes. They
are useful to standardise the entries to aid searches of metadata for
specified values. The code lists included in UK GEMINI are taken from
ISO 19115. In some cases, the explanations of the values have been
modified to make them more appropriate to the UK context.

Some of these code lists will require extension. Additional codes may be
created as follows:

. identify the new value, which should be distinct from existing values;
. choose a name that encapsulates the essential concept;
. provide a definition that is understandable and concise;
. chose a new code that has not been used before for this element;
. document the new codes, and disseminate them to users.

Such code extensions may be either specific to a metadata implementation
in an organisation or sector, or for general usage. In the latter case,
proposed new codes should be
submitted{nbsp}to{nbsp}gemini@agi.org.uk{nbsp}for
inclusion in the next version of UK GEMINI. It is expected that future
editions of UK GEMINI will incorporate such modified code lists.

*Note that any new code values cannot be used in a national metadata
service until incorporated in the Standard, nor will they be valid for
the purposes of INSPIRE.*
