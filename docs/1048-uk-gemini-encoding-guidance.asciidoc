== Introduction

=== Purpose of guidelines

The purpose of these guidelines is to explain, with the aid of examples,
how to encode UK GEMINI metadata using XSD schemas of ISO / TC 211.
Examples are in the form of fragments of XML.

UK GEMINI metadata may be for a dataset, dataset series or a service.
The encoding of all types is covered.

=== Scope

The scope of these guidelines is the encoding of UK GEMINI
[https://www.agi.org.uk/40-gemini/1047-metadata-guidelines-for-geospatial-data-resources-part-3[4]]according
to ISO 19139, ISO 19119 and ISO 19136, in a way that adheres to the
INSPIRE technical guidelines
[https://www.agi.org.uk/40-gemini/1047-metadata-guidelines-for-geospatial-data-resources-part-3[9]]
for encoding metadata.

Outside the scope of this document is the description of GEMINI2
metadata items, their content, obligation and meaning. Readers seeking
this information should consult the GEMINI2 standard
[https://www.agi.org.uk/40-gemini/1047-metadata-guidelines-for-geospatial-data-resources-part-3[4]].

=== Assumed knowledge

It is assumed that readers will be familiar with XML. Readers who
require background information are referred to the W3Schools
introduction to XML:

* XML -{nbsp}http://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_whatis.asp

Readers requiring an introduction to XML Schemas are referred to the
W3Schools XML Schema tutorial:

* XSD{nbsp}-{nbsp}http://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_schema.asp

=== Terminology

A Glossary is
provided{nbsp}https://www.agi.org.uk/40-gemini/1056-glossary[here].

=== Structure of document

The core section,{nbsp}Encoding Guidelines,{nbsp}is split into four principal
sections

* The first section deals with the schemas
* The second deals with concepts which are common to all kinds of
GEMINI2 metadata instances.
* The third explains the encoding of metadata for datasets and dataset
series.
* The fourth section explains the encoding of encoding metadata for
services.

There is some overlap, and therefore duplication, between the sections
but it is felt that this approach is best in that it clearly indicates
the requirements for each type of metadata.

The 'Metadata for datasets and dataset series' and 'Metadata for
services' sections{nbsp}list metadata items from GEMINI2 in the order that
they appear in GEMINI2. XML elements in an XML document must follow
the{nbsp}https://www.agi.org.uk/40-gemini/1046-xml-element-order[order{nbsp}]expressed
in the XSD schema to which the XML document conforms. The order of XML
element expressed by the XSD schema will not be the same as the order of
metadata items in GEMINI2.

Examples are provided by way of XML fragments throughout the document.
Full metadata instances are shown here:

https://github.com/AGIuk/Schematron/blob/master/samples/1044-ds.xml[Dataset
metadata instance example]

https://github.com/AGIuk/Schematron/blob/master/samples/1042-sv.xml[Service
metadata instance example]

=== XML Fragments

This document contains examples of XML encoding. The examples are
considered fragments in that they are not complete XML documents. The
following conventions are used:

* The root element will generally be shown and it shall be
gmd:MD_Metadata
* XML element tags will generally be shown on a single line
* XML will be tabbed in where possible to aid reading
* Where an XML element, including the start tag, end tag and content, is
too long to show on a single line, it shall break across more than one
line automatically (i.e. under the control of browser justification and
text wrapping)
* Missing XML content, removed while forming the fragment, shall be
represented by an ellipsis (...)

.XML fragment – tabbing
[source, xml]
----
<gmd:MD_Metadata>
 	<gmd:fileIdentifier>
		<gco:CharacterString>98e25be5-388d-4be3-bc5f-ba07ef6009b2</gco:CharacterString>
		</gmd:fileIdentifier>
		 ...
</gmd:MD_Metadata>
----

Figure 1 shows an example of an XML fragment. Note that it starts with
the XML element `gmd:MD_Metadata`. The next XML element in order is
`gmd:fileIdentifier` and its start-tag is on the next line and is tabbed
in. The following line is the content of `gmd:fileIdentifier`.

An ellipsis follows the end tag of the XML element `gmd:fileIdentifier`
indicating that other content is missing

Also deliberately omitted from XML fragments is:

* The XML declaration
* XML namespace identifiers

In the example in Figure 1 CharacterString is an XML element in the
namespace gco. It has the start-tag `<gco:CharacterString>` and the
end-tag `</gco:CharacterString>`. The
string `98e25be5-388d-4be3-bc5f-ba07ef6009b2` is the element’s content.
The CharacterString element forms the content of another element:
fileIdentifier. Its start-tag is `<gmd:fileIdentifier>` and its end-tag
is `</gmd:fileIdentifier>`. In the example
below `gml:id` and `codeSpace` are XML attributes. XML attributes are
encoded in the start-tag of an element with the
form `[namespace]:[attributeName]="[content]"`.

.XML attributes
[example]

`...` +
`<gmx:CodeDefinition gml:id="MD_ScopeCode_dataset">` +
`{nbsp}{nbsp} <gml:description>information applies to the dataset</gml:description>` +
`{nbsp}{nbsp} <gml:identifier codeSpace="ISOTC211/19115">dataset</gml:identifier>` +
`</gmx:CodeDefinition>` +
`...`

Note that there is no reason in practice to tab in XML and to present
each XML element on a new line other than to aid humans in reading raw
XML. XML parsers, on the other hand, would have no problem reading the
XML were it encoded without carriage returns as shown in Figure 3.

[example]

`<gmd:MD_Metadata><gmd:fileIdentifier><gco:CharacterString>98e25be5-388d-4be3-bc5f-ba07ef6009b2</gco:CharacterString></gmd:fileIdentifier></gmd:MD_Metadata>`

[#1.6]####The UK Location Information Infrastructure will accept any
valid XML document that conforms to these guidelines. This includes
canonical XML encodings
[https://www.agi.org.uk/40-gemini/1047-metadata-guidelines-for-geospatial-data-resources-part-3[5]]
and files laid out with additional white space for human readability,
and other variants in between. Similarly, XML attribute values could be
delimited using single or double quotes.

== Encoding Guidelines

=== Schemas

The schemas defining the structure of GEMINI2 metadata instances must
implement:

* ISO 19139:2007 – for a physical implementation of ISO 19115:2003
* ISO 19119:2005 – for service metadata
* ISO 19136:2007 – for GML

Several schema sets have been identified as meeting these requirements:

. http://schemas.opengis.net/csw/2.0.2/profiles/apiso/1.0.0/apiso.xsd,
provided by OGC
. http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/draft-schemas/inspire-md-schemas/apiso-inspire/apiso-inspire.xsd,
provided by JRC
. http://schemas.opengis.net/iso/19139/20070417, provided by OGC.

Both 1 & 2 import the same dataset schemas, which are authoritatively at
the ISO TC211 resource
site:{nbsp}https://schemas.isotc211.org/schemas/19139/. Note: this is a human
browsable site; if you want to validate correctly against this set of
schemas, you can 'deep link' to
e.g.{nbsp}https://schemas.isotc211.org/schemas/19139/-/gmx/1.0/gmx.xsd[https://schemas.isotc211.org/schemas/19139/-/gmx/1.0/gmx.xsd]

The schema files that shall be used for validating GEMINI2 metadata
instances are:

* gmx.xsd (Datasets and dataset series metadata)
* gmx.xsd and srv.xsd (Service metadata)

The AP-ISO schema files given above import both of these, so a validator
does not need to determine what type of record it is validating.

With schema set 3, the dataset and service schemas have separate entry
points: gmx/gmx.xsd and srv/srv.xsd

Notes:

. the schemas provided by ISO TC211 do not include anything for ISO
19119 service metadata, but could be used directly to validate dataset
metadata
. the older draft schemas published
at{nbsp}http://schemas.opengis.net/iso/19139/20060504/{nbsp}import GML version 3.1
instead of GML 3.2, so records that validate with one will not validate
with the other.
. the UK GEMINI schema that was published on GI Gateway [service
withdrawn in 2012] encodes GEMINI1, not GEMINI2. Also, it does not
conform with INSPIRE technical guidance. Therefore, it cannot be used to
encode GEMINI2 and shall not be used for metadata instances within UK
Location.

*Schema Validation*

The XML schemaLocation property officially provides only a ‘hint’ to the
validator, but many validators do use the schemas at that location.

The INSPIRE Validator available
through{nbsp}https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/validator/about/{nbsp}includes metadata
validation.

=== Common concepts

==== XML declaration

Metadata instances are XML documents. XML documents should, but do not
have to, begin with an XML declaration. If a metadata instance has an
XML declaration then it must be the first line in the document. It must
not be preceded by anything else, other than an invisible Unicode
byte-order mark.

Figure 4{nbsp}shows an XML declaration. The version attribute must always
have the value 1.0. The encoding attribute is optional. Its value
specifies which character set is in use in the document. By default
(i.e. if the encoding attribute is omitted) XML documents are assumed to
be encoded in the UTF-8 encoding of the Unicode character set. Care
should be taken when using text editing software to edit XML, or writing
XML using bespoke software code, that the XML’s actual physical encoding
conforms with the encoding stated with this attribute. It is expected
that the UTF-8 character set will be sufficient in nearly all cases.

An XML declaration may include a “standalone” attribute. However, this
attribute is only relevant if an XML document is using a DTD. Metadata
instances of GEMINI2 shall not use a DTD so it is out of scope.

====== *Figure 4 - XML declaration{nbsp}*

`<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>`

==== Root element

The root element of a GEMINI2 metadata instance shall be
gmd:MD_Metadata. The root element shall contain namespace references to,
at least, gmd, gco, gml and xlink. Metadata for services shall, in
addition, contain a namespace reference to srv. In addition reference
may be made to the gmx namespace if XML elements such as gmx:Anchor are
used.

An example is shown in Figure 5. Subsequent examples omit the namespace
references for brevity. An ellipsis is used to indicate that required
content has been omitted.

====== *Figure{nbsp} 5 - Root Element*

`{nbsp} ...` +
`</gmd:MD_Metadata>`

The namespace identifier for gmd shall be:
http://www.isotc211.org/2005/gmd

The namespace identifier for gco shall be:
http://www.isotc211.org/2005/gco

The namespace identifier for srv shall be:
http://www.isotc211.org/2005/srv

The namespace identifier for gmx shall be:
http://www.isotc211.org/2005/gmx

The namespace identifier for xlink shall be:
http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink

The namespace identifier for gml shall be:
http://www.opengis.net/gml/3.2

Note that {nbsp}http://www.opengis.net/gml/3.2{nbsp}refers to GML version
3.2.1{nbsp}*not*{nbsp}GML version 3.2.0.

The root element, and in fact any element in an XML instance, may have
an attribute called xsi:schemaLocation which contains a value or set of
values{nbsp}**hinting{nbsp}**at the physical location of schemas which may be used
for validation. Since this attribute provides only a hint, validating
parsers are allowed to ignore it and use other means of locating the
relevant schemas.

Figure 6 shows a root element containing an xsi:schemaLocation
attribute. Here the schemas referenced are in the INSPIRE Metadata{nbsp}XSD
repository.

Since the xsi:schemaLocation attribute exists in the xsi namespace, this
namespace must be referenced. The xsi:schemaLocation attribute contains
a pair of space separated values when one schema is identified. The
first value specifies the namespace and the second value specifies the
schema to use to validate elements in that namespace. When more than one
schema is identified, as would be the case for validating a service
metadata instance, the attribute contains a space separated sequence of
namespace / schema pairs. The xsi:schemaLocation attribute is not
required in a GEMINI2 metadata instance.

`{nbsp} ...` +
`</gmd:MD_Metadata>`

==== Dates and Times

Dates and date-time shall be expressed in the Gregorian calendar and UTC
as per ISO 8601. The formatting shall be as follows, in order of
increasing precision:

* yyyy (e.g. 1995)
* yyyy-MM (e.g. 1995-01)
* yyyy-MM-dd (e.g. 1995-01-25)
* yyyy-MM-ddThh:mm:ss (e.g. 1995-01-25T12:01:55)

The ISO 8601 encoding also allows negative dates to represent BC.
However, gco:Date and gco:DateTime XML elements do not accept negative
values.

The GEMINI2 standard states that temporal extents may be given with as
coarse a granularity as century (e.g. yy or 19). However, unfortunately
this cannot be encoded in ISO 19139 XML and will result in a schema
validation error. The lowest level of granularity allowable is the year.

==== Element order

XML elements in a metadata instance must follow the order in which the
elements are defined in an XSD schema. Failure to do so will result in
schema validation errors. The order of XML elements and their
corresponding GEMINI2 metadata items is
shown{nbsp}https://www.agi.org.uk/40-gemini/1046-xml-element-order[here].

==== Patterns for multiple instances

Some metadata items, such as alternative title, have cardinalities for
more than one. This means that more than one instance of the item can be
encoded in metadata instances. The general approach in ISO 19139 XML is
that an XML element expressing the property, in Figure7
gmd:alternateTitle, contains an XML element which expresses the data
type and contains the value, in this case gco:CharacterString. Note that
more than one alternative title is expressed by repeating the
gmd:alternateTitle XML element, not the gco:CharacterString XML element
(shown in an invalid example in Figure 8). This pattern is followed
throughout ISO 19139 XML including for XML elements that have complex
content, such as gmd:identificationInfo (Figure 9).

`{nbsp} ...` +
`</gmd:MD_Metadata>{nbsp}`

==== File identifier

The first XML child element of any GEMINI2 metadata instance shall be
gmd:fileIdentifier. The content of this XML element is the identifier of
the metadata instance. {nbsp} File identifier is not to be confused with the
metadata
item{nbsp}https://www.agi.org.uk/40-gemini/1062-gemini-datasets-and-data-series#36[Resource
Identifier].

The content of the XML element shall be a unique managed identifier,
such as a system generated UUID. Once the identifier has been set for a
metadata instance it shall not change.

`{nbsp} ...` +
`</gmd:MD_Metadata>{nbsp}`

==== Citation

External resources, such as publications, controlled vocabularies, are
expressed using the ISO 19115 class CI_Citation and its XML element
instance, gmd:CI_Citation. This is a common structure that is used to
encode:

* Resource reference information about datasets and series
* Resource reference information about services
* Information about the originating controlled vocabulary of keywords
* The specification for conformance statements
* The authority of Spatial Reference System
* The authority of Extent

A citation must include at least a title, a date and a date type.{nbsp}Figure
11 shows the citation structure used to encode information about the
GEMET Concepts dictionary.

In any one citation there may be more than one date. However, there
shall be only one date with a date type of ‘creation’ and there shall be
only one date with type 'revision'.

Addresses are expressed using the ISO 19115 class CI_ResponsibleParty
and its XML element instance, gmd:CI_ResponsibleParty. This is a common
structure that is used to encode:

* Metadata contact
* Responsible organisation

In the context of GEMINI2 a responsible party set shall include at least
the organisation name (encoded using gmd:organisationName), an email
address (encoded using gmd:electronicMailAddress) and a role (encoded
using gmd:role).

The XML element role takes values from the ISO 19115 codelist
CI_RoleCode. Any value in the code list may be chosen.

Additionally, the contact position (encoded using gmd:positionName), the
postal address (encoded using a combination of gmd:deliveryPoint,
gmd:city, gmd:administrativeArea, gmd:postalCode and gmd:country),
telephone number (encoded using gmd:voice) and facsimile number (encoded
using gmd:facsimile) may be provided.

==== Code lists

Where a sub-item takes its value from a code list, which may or may not
be expressed in ISO 19115, the source code list catalogue and code list
value shall be expressed using the attributes gmd:codeList and
gmd:codeListValue respectively.

Figure 13 shows the encoding where a code list is specified in ISO
19115. The value of the codeList attribute should be the URL for the ISO
19115 code list catalogue that is published on the ISO website:

https://standards.iso.org/iso/19139/resources/gmxCodelists.xml[https://schemas.isotc211.org/schemas/19139/resources/gmxCodelists.xml]

Plus a hash character acting as a delimiter, and then the identifier of
the code list, in this case ‘MD_ScopeCode’, that contains the code list
value that is used. This information could be used to validate the code
list value and ensure that it is a member of the code list.

The value of the code list value attribute (gmd:codeListValue) shall be
a valid entry from the specified code list dictionary.

The element value (i.e. in Figure
13{nbsp}{nbsp}`<gmd:MD_ScopeCode ...>dataset</gmd:MD_ScopeCode>`) is human
readable text. It can be omitted or given a value different from that of
the attribute codeListValue (e.g. Dataset). {nbsp}Developers of GEMINI aware
applications should note that reliance should not be placed on the
element value of code list elements but rather on the value of the
attribute gmd:codeListValue.

==== Null Values

The ISO 19139 XML schemas provide a means for indicating that the
contents of an element may be unknown or withheld, through the use of
the gco:nilReason attribute. This attribute can be added to any element
in the gmd namespace. It can take the following values:

* inapplicable
* missing
* template
* unknown
* withheld
* other:[any text]

Empty XML elements (see Figure 15) are not permitted in ISO 19139
metadata instances. Although this is not checked by the “Table A”
schematron rules in use in UK Location, those creating metadata records
should avoid creating empty XML elements if at all possible. If an
optional element is not required, don’t include it; if a mandatory
element is not available use gco:nilReason.

====== *Figure 15 - Examples of empty elements not permitted in GEMINI metadata instances*

`<gco:CharacterString/>`

`<gco:CharacterString></gco:CharacterString>`

`<gmx:Anchor />`

`<gmx:Anchor></gmx:Anchor>`

The following metadata items shall not be nillable:

* Title
* Abstract
* Bounding box (west, east, south and north coordinates)
* Unique resource identifier
* Responsible organization
* Metadata point of contact
* Topic category
* Originating controlled vocabulary title
* File identifier

==== By Value or By Reference

The content of a metadata instance may be expressed{nbsp}_by value_{nbsp}or{nbsp}_by
reference_.{nbsp}_By value_{nbsp}means that the metadata instance carries all the
necessary information.{nbsp}_By reference_{nbsp}means that a metadata instance
indicates that content is to be found in an external repository or
another place within the same instance. The{nbsp}_by reference_{nbsp}case is
supported by the object reference (gco:ObjectReference) attribute group.
This provides two mechanisms for referencing remote resources:

* XLink, primarily using the xlink:href attribute
* By UUID using the uuidref attribute

Figure 16{nbsp}shows the use of the XLink href attribute to specify a
vertical CRS by reference to the EPSG Geodetic parameter dataset
while{nbsp}Figure 17{nbsp}shows the same information encoded by value (note
however, that in this case the domain of validity
(gml:domainOfValidity), vertical coordinate system (gml:verticalCS) and
vertical datum (gml:verticalDatum) are themselves encoded{nbsp}_by
reference_).

Encoding information{nbsp}_by reference_{nbsp}is clearly advantageous in the sense
that it is more efficient (in terms of file size but also avoiding data
duplication) than by value. However, it presupposes that an XML software
application will ‘know’ how to dereference the reference. Dereferencing
is the act of obtaining the externally referenced information. It is
also important that the referenced information is universally available
in a structured machine readable form so that it can be incorporated by
value. In the case of the examples below the EPSG web service endpoint
can be used to dereference the EPSG URN to return the GML encoded
vertical CRS. The GML can be directly incorporated in an XML metadata
instance, where the metadata element accepts a GML value (noting that
there will be a difference in the GML namespace identifier – EPSG
returning GML 3.1.1 while metadata instances shall identify the GML
3.2.1 namespace – in the case of the CRS XML elements of GML there is no
difference between these versions of GML).

Typically,{nbsp}_by reference_{nbsp}shall be used for identifying the vertical CRS
of a vertical extent and the implementation of coupled resource
(following INSPIRE guidelines) alone. The XLink mechanism shall be used
(see{nbsp}Figure 16{nbsp}for vertical CRS and Figure 18 for coupled resource).
Note that in encoding coupled resource by referencing the uuidref
attribute may also be used, in addition to XLink. All other metadata
items shall be implemented{nbsp}_by value_.

==== Identifiers

GML XML elements which are used in metadata have an optional gml:id
attribute. The value domain of the identifier is referred to as{nbsp}_XML
name_. XML names have certain restrictions. They may contain any
alphanumeric character, non-English alphanumeric characters, ideograms
and the underscore, hyphen and period. They may not contain any other
punctuation characters. The colon is allowed, but its use is reserved
for namespaces, so it cannot appear in an identifier. XML names may not
include any whitespace including spaces and carriage returns. All names
beginning with the letters XML (in uppercase, lowercase or any mixture
thereof) are reserved (see
[https://www.agi.org.uk/40-gemini/1047-metadata-guidelines-for-geospatial-data-resources-part-3[11]]
pages 18 and 19).

XML names may only start with letters, ideograms and the underscore
character. Consequently, care must be taken when using the value of a
UUID as the value of an identifier because these can begin with numeric
characters. {nbsp}If using UUIDs as the basis of such an identifier best
practice is to prefix the UUIDs with an underscore.

An identifier must be unique within the scope of any{nbsp}XML document (i.e.
there shall not be more than one id type attribute with a particular
identifier value) that the metadata record might occur in, such as a
result set from a CSW query and not just the metadata document itself.

If an id type attribute contains an illegally formed XML name the result
will be a schema validation error.

===== 2.2.13 Free text

In GEMINI2 there are two ways of encoding free text. {nbsp}The basic{nbsp}element
for providing text of unrestricted length with no internal XML structure
is gco:CharacterString. This element is appropriate when the text does
not refer to a specific external resource or registry. {nbsp}When the
{nbsp}provided text is a term or code referring to an externally defined
explanation or registry value, gmx:Anchor element is{nbsp}*recommended*{nbsp}over
gco:CharacterString. gmx:Anchor contains an additional attribute group
enabling linking the provided piece of text with an external describing
resource. The most important of these attributes in this context is
xlink:href, which contains the actual reference in Uniform Resource
Identifier (URI) format.

For example the encoding of an identifier/code value should be done with
gmx:Anchor as in Figure 19, rather than gco:CharacterString (Figure 20),
when the unique resource identifier is referenceable,

===== [#2.2.14]###2.2.14 Limitations, conditions, and licences

GEMINI contains two elements, 25{nbsp}_Limitations on public access_{nbsp}and
26{nbsp}_Use constraints_. These represent the two INSPIRE
elements{nbsp}_Limitations on public access_{nbsp}and{nbsp}_Conditions applying to
access and use_, and are therefore both encoded with ISO 19115
MD_LegalConstraints elements. INSPIRE requires that they are encoded in
separate MD_LegalConstraints elements. This means that a GEMINI metadata
record must contain at least two MD_LegalConstraints elements.

INSPIRE requires that both of these elements use MD_RestrictionCode =
otherRestrictions. Because GEMINI element 26 is for{nbsp}*use*{nbsp}constraints,
it makes sense for both elements to place this inside a useConstraints
element. Having specified{nbsp}_otherRestrictions_, each shall then use one
or more{nbsp}_otherConstraints_{nbsp}elements to specify the actual constraints.

For{nbsp}_Limitations on public access_, at least one of
the{nbsp}__otherConstraints{nbsp}__elements shall use gmx:Anchor to indicate the
kind of constraint, by reference to the appropriate entry in the INSPIRE
registry
(http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/metadata-codelist/LimitationsOnPublicAccess).
The free text within the anchor can provide human readable detail.

For{nbsp}_Use constraints_, if there are no conditions, or the conditions are
unknown, then use gmx:Anchor to reference the appropriate entry in the
INSPIRE registry
(http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/metadata-codelist/ConditionsApplyingToAccessAndUse).
Similarly, if the conditions are documented in a license, use gmx:Anchor
to reference the full license text. The free text within the anchor can
provide a human readable summary. If the conditions are not available at
a URL, they can be entered as plain text; see FIgure 22b.

===== 2.3.1 Data identification

XML elements for encoding metadata for datasets and series of datasets
are drawn, primarily, from the gmd and gco namespaces and also the gml
and xlink namespaces. Identification information is encoded using the
gmd:MD_DataIdentification type (Figure 23).

Metadata instances may include more than one gmd:identificationInfo XML
element. The first gmd:identificationInfo XML element in a GEMINI
metadata instance for datasets or series shall have as its first and
only child XML element gmd:MD_DataIdentification. The ISO 19115
hierarchyLevel element shall be set to “dataset” or “series”. For a
series, ISO 19115 hierarchyLevelName element must also be set, to
