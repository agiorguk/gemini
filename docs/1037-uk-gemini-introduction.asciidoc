= UK-GEMINI Introduction
include::./includes/attributes.asciidoc[]

This page describes the requirements and guidance for metadata
conforming to the UK standard known as UK GEMINI. There are several
entry points to the guidance:

* link:1063-gemini-services.html[GEMINI for services]
* Other material

Conformance to GEMINI should ensure conformance to the INSPIRE Implementing Rules. UK specific guidance is provided. +
If you're thinking, why GEMINI? Why not just use the INSPIRE Metadata guidance or the ISO standards?{nbsp}https://www.agi.org.uk/why-uk-gemini/[Click here for some reasons.] +
The https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/recommended-open-standards-for-government/using-metadata-to-describe-data-shared-within-government[UK Government Digital Service recommends using GEMINI when describing geographic data] 
and it is the preferred way to catalogue geographic data and services at Data.gov.uk.

Both UK GEMINI and the INSPIRE Technical Guidance have been developed from the International Standard
http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=26020[ISO 19115:2003] Geographic information - Metadata, with supplementary material from ISO 19119:2005 Geographic information - Services.
The XML encoding follows ISO 19139:2007 Geographic information - Metadata - XML encoding. This means that a GEMINI record is widely understood by geospatial software and users internationally.

Note that GEMINI (and the INSPIRE Guidance) are about metadata for
datasets, series, and services (collectively, 'resources'); not
everything in a GEMINI record can be assumed to be true individually for
each feature instance in the resource. The underlying ISO standards
(19115, 19139) do allow for metadata at the instance level, so the
elements could be used to describe metadata for that, but the guidance
here may not be appropriate and the resulting record could not be
validated as a GEMINI (or INSPIRE) record.

Here is
a link:1055-uk-gemini-major-changes-since-1-0.html[summary of changes] from earlier versions.

Here is a link:1250-element-summary.html/[summary] of the GEMINI elements (similar to Table 1 and Table 2 in GEMINI 2.2).

Note: in GEMINI 2.3, the GEMINI Element number is called "GEMINI id";
the actual numbers have not changed, where the same element was in GEMINI 2.2.

== Software that implements GEMINI 2.3

Several software implementations exist and are in use across the UK:

* https://geonetwork-opensource.org/[GeoNetwork Open Source] {nbsp}-{nbsp}https://github.com/AstunTechnology/iso19139.gemini23[GEMINI plugin]: server software in use in several government departments
* https://www.medin.org.uk/data/submit-metadata[MEDIN metadata editors]: online and downloadable client editors for the MEDIN community profile
