|===
|UK GEMINI id |43

|Definition |Level of detail expressed as the scale denominator of a
comparable hardcopy map or chart

|Purpose and meaning |This is purely to conform to INSPIRE, and has
little meaning for most digital data

|Obligation |Optional

|Occurrence |Multiple

|Data type |Integer

|Domain |Positive integer

|Guidance |Where the data is captured from a map, the scale of that map
should be recorded.

|Comment |Expression of spatial resolution by distance is preferred.
Spatial resolution should only be expressed by equivalent scale where a
distance cannot be determined.

|Examples |5,000

|Guidelines a|
* For services, it is not possible to express the restriction of a
service concerning the spatial resolution when using the ISO 19139 XML
Schema.
* It shall be expressed in the Abstract.
* The spatial resolution restriction text shall include either an
equivalent scale as integer valued scale denominator or a resolution
distance using a numerical length value and with a unit of length.
