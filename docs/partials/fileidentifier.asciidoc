|UK GEMINI id |45

|Definition |Unique identifier for this metadata file

|Purpose and meaning |To support the operation of UK Location and
INSPIRE, discovery metadata records must include a File Identifier for
the resource.

|Obligation |Mandatory

|Occurrence |Single

|Data type |CharacterString

|Domain |Free text

|Guidance a|
. File Identifier must be populated with a unique identifier. This may
be a UUID generated by a metadata creation tool. +
*Once created and published to UK Location, the File Identifier must not
be changed.* +
A change to the File Identifier would represent the creation of a new
resource. +
If the UK Catalogue receives two records with the same File Identifier,
the one with the more recent metadata date will be retained.
. Persistence and uniqueness across the metadata infrastructure are key
. Only use characters that are allowed in URIs
(https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt[RFC3986]), in particular, do not
use curly brackets
. http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/cat[ISO AP 1.0] recommends
that it is a UUID

|Comment |File Identifier should not be confused with the UK GEMINI2
metadata item link:#36[Resource identifier], which identifies the data
resource being described. +

Encoding guidelines...

|===
|Guidelines a|
. The first XML child element of any GEMINI2 metadata instance shall be
gmd:fileIdentifier. The content of this XML element is the identifier of
the metadata instance. File identifier is not a metadata item of
GEMINI2. It is not to be confused with the metadata item
link:#36[Resource identifier].
. The content of the XML element shall be a unique managed identifier,
such as a system generated UUID. Once the identifier has been set for a
metadata instance it shall not change.

|Errors observed a|
. Two records with the same identifier, resulting in only one being
harvested
. New identifier for an existing record, leading to duplicate records
. Identifiers wrapped in curly brackets
