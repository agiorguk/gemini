. A code should be selected from ISO 639-2, which uses three-letter
primary tags with optional subtags â€“ see
http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php
. The values for the UK languages are:
+
[cols=",",]
!===
!*English* !eng
!*Welsh* !cym
!*Irish* !gle
!*Gaelic (Scottish)* !gla
!*Cornish* !cor
!*Ulster Scots* !sco
!===
+
ISO 639-2 allows either 'cym' or 'wel' for Welsh, but two values for the
same language causes confusion, and it is recommended that 'cym' be
used.
. In many cases, a default value of 'eng' can be applied.
. Other official European languages are listed at
http://ec.europa.eu/languages/policy/linguistic-diversity/official-languages-eu_en.htm[Official
languages of the EU].
. If there is no textual information in the data resource, then the
special code value *zxx* of ISO 639-2/B reserved for "no linguistic
content; not applicable" shall be used.

|Guidelines

. Note that according to the ISO 19115 logical model the language
property is typed as a CharacterString. The use of the
gco:CharacterString type is permitted by the ISO 19139 schemas but this
approach shall not be used to encode GEMINI2 metadata. Instead the XML
element gmd:LanguageCode, which substitutes for gco:CharacterString,
shall be used.
. The XML element gmd:LanguageCode is implemented as a code list
element. Note that the codeList attribute should have the following
value in GEMINI2 metadata instances:
http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php
. Note however, that this URL resolves to an HTML web page rather than a
service endpoint providing ISO 639-2 language codes.
