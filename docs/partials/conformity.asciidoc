|Guidance a|
. For Gemini compliance, you shall provide a conformity statement referring to the INSPIRE specifications, even if the dataset or service is not conformant, or you didn't test it.
# tag::dataset[]
. Datasets and dataset series shall declare conformity to [INSPIRE Regulation 1089/2010] and shall use the title and citation date in the example and encoding guidelines below.
# end::dataset[]
# tag::service[]
. Metadata about invocable spatial data services shall declare conformity to [INSPIRE Regulation 1089/2010] and shall use the title and citation date in the example and encoding guidelines below.
. Metadata about network services shall declare conformity to [INSPIRE Regulation 976/2009].
# end::service[]
. Other conformity statements may be added, where each conformity statement shall relate to only one specification.
. Each conformity statement shall relate to only one specification
. Each conformity statement shall state the specification that it is about, the degree of conformity (true or false) and optionally an 'Explanation', for example to reference the conformance criteria in the specification against which conformance is being claimed.

|Comment a|
. For INSPIRE, the citation title shall be the official title of the
INSPIRE Implementing Rule, specification document or Conformance Class
. For INSPIRE, the date given will be the date of publication of the
INSPIRE Implementing Rule, specification document or Conformance Class
. For INSPIRE Implementing Rule documents, the value of the title
element shall match exactly the official title of the cited document in
the language of the metadata.
. If conformity with INSPIRE has not been evaluated, the degree (gmd:pass) element shall be empty and contain a nil reason attribute with value "unknown"

|Examples |Conformance of a dataset to Regulation 1089/2010 would have
the title: +
Commission Regulation (EU) No 1089/2010 of 23 November 2010 implementing
Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as
regards interoperability of spatial data sets and services., +
and would give a publication date of 2010-12-08

.Encoding guidelines...
[%collapsible]

[cols="a,a"]
|===
| Guidelines
|
. The encoding for Conformity is shown in the example.
. Note that the encoding of conformity requires a specification (encoded
using gmd:CI_Citation), an explanation and a pass.
. INSPIRE Metadata Implementing Rules state that there are three
possible conformance results: conformant, not conformant and not
evaluated. Not evaluated is expressed by a conformity statement with a
nilReason (unknown) specified in the pass element.
# tag::dataset[]
. All gmd:dataQualityInfo XML element shall have a gmd:scope XML
element, set to 'dataset' or 'series' as appropriate.
# end::dataset[]
# tag::service[]
. All gmd:dataQualityInfo XML element shall have a gmd:scope XML
element, set to 'service'.
. It is important to note that if the scope of the data quality
information is 'service' then the gmd:levelDescription XML element is
required, as shown below.

.Metadata errors observed...
[%collapsible]
====
|===
|Errors observed |*Conformity statement missing* +
INSPIRE requires a 'conformity' statement, which can say that the
resource conforms, or does not conform to a specification, or that it
hasn't been tested. +
This is encoded with an ISO 19139 quality report. +
*Incorrect citation of INSPIRE regulation* +
When citing the INSPIRE regulation, the title and publication date need
to match exactly. +
Any deviation may result in the validation failure message "The gmd:pass
element is not nillable and shall have a value" - even if the error is
in the spelling of the title.
