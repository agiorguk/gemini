== Metadata Date
include::includes/partials-attributes.adoc[]
[#30]

|===
|UK GEMINI id |30

|Definition |Date on which the metadata was last updated, or was
confirmed as being up-to-date, or if not updated, then the date it was
created

|Purpose and meaning |This is the date at which the metadata can be
considered current (rather than the dataset itself). It may be the date
at which the metadata was reviewed and confirmed as being 'current'. It
is used to distinguish which of two records with the same fileIdentifier
the system will keep.

|Obligation |Mandatory

|Occurrence |Single

|Data type |Date

|Domain |Single date as specified by BS ISO 8601 in the extended date
format (YYYY-MM-DD), where YYYY is the year, MM is the month and DD is
the day. Time (HH:MM:SS, where HH is the hour, MM the minutes and SS the
seconds) may be added if required, separated from the day by 'T'.

|Guidance a|
. This should be updated whenever the metadata is updated due to a
change in the dataset, or when it is reviewed and confirmed as wholly
correct.
. The date should be at an appropriate level of resolution (e.g. the
day, or the day and month).
. The date should not be in the future.

|Comment |If the metadata has not been updated, then this should be the
date when it was created.

|Errors observed |This is used to distinguish which of two records with
the same fileIdentifier the system will keep. Even if the records are
moved to a different server, if the fileIdentifier and metadata date are
the same, the harvester will not collect the new files.
