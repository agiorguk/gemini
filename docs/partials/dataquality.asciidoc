|Definition |Quantitative aspects of data quality

|Purpose and meaning |To allow quantitative description of the
completeness, consistency, accuracy, and correctness of the data

|Obligation |Conditional: Topological consistency report is mandatory if
the dataset includes types from the INSPIRE Generic Network Model and
does not assure centerline topology (connectivity of centrelines) for
the network, otherwise optional

|Occurrence |Multiple

|Data type |Class, subtypes of DQ_Element

|Domain a|
DQ_Element from ISO 19115

DQ_Element is an abstract complex type and has to be expressed by a
corresponding DQ_xxx subelement concerning the particular data quality
issue e.g. DQ_ConceptualConsistency. All these types have the same
sub-attributes, such as nameOfMeasure, dateTime, result. It is important
to choose the correct subelement, to clearly indicate the type of
quality statement being made. Only the result sub-element (value, value
type) is mandatory. All DQ_Element subtypes have the same sub-elements.

[cols="a,a"]

|Guidelines
| There shall be exactly one gmd:dataQualityInfo/gmd:DQ_DataQuality
element scoped to the entire described data set or data set series. So
if the scope of the quality measure is the entire dataset or series,
then the result shall be in the same DQ_DataQuality element as the
Conformity and Lineage elements

Other quality measures, e.g. for specific feature types, shall be
separate DQ_DataQuality elements, with the relevant Quality scope

Quantitative results shall be reported using the relevant
gmd:report/gmd:DQ_XXXXX element with a gmd:DQ_QuantitativeResult element
as the value of its mandatory gmd:result property.

The gmd:valueUnit and gmd:value/gco:Record child elements of
gmd:DQ_QuantitativeResult shall be used for giving a numerical or
otherwise quantitative value.

The value type of the result shall be declared using the xsi:type
attribute of the gco:Record element. Note that many of the INSPIRE Data
Specifications give a value type of “Real, percentage, ratio”; GEMINI
recommends using real numbers in all these cases, which should be
declared as xs:double.

As well as the mandatory elements, it is also recommended to supply a
name of the measure, a short description of the evaluation method, and a
date for the evaluation of the consistency check
