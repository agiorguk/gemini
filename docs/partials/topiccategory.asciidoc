|Guidance a|
. Select one or more categories that most closely represent the topic of
the data resource.
. If in doubt, go by the topic categories rather than the examples.
. It is not necessary to include all categories which may be applicable,
but only a limited number of most relevant should be chosen (e.g.
topographic maps should not be classified as farming).

|Guidelines
|
. The encoding example for topic category is shown in Example One. Note
that it is possible to include more than one topic category.
. The value of the XML element gmd:MD_TopicCategoryCode must not contain
whitespace because the values are specified by an enumerated list in the
XSD schemas. The encoding shown in Example Two, for example, will result
in an XSD schema validation error because the element content will be
parsed as shown in Example 3 (excluding the square brackets denoting the
start and end) resulting in a value that does not exist in the
enumerated list.
