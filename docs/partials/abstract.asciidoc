The abstract should provide a clear statement of the content of the data
and not general background information.

. State what the 'things' are that are recorded.
. State the key aspects recorded about these things.
. State what form the data takes.
. State any other limiting information, such as time period of validity
of the data.
. Add purpose of data resource where relevant (e.g. for survey data).
. Include a description of the extent or location.
. Include legal references.
. Aim to be understood by non-experts.
. Do not include general background information.
. Avoid jargon and unexplained abbreviations.
. Acronyms should be expanded to the full name along with the
abbreviated version at the beginning of the abstract. The abbreviated
version can then be used (see examples below).

Note: the Schematron validation will raise an error if the abstract is
less than 100 characters, or is the same as the title.

summarised in the first sentence, or the first 256 characters.
