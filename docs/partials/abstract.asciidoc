The abstract should provide a clear statement of the content of the data
and not general background information.

. State what the 'things' are that are recorded.
. State the key aspects recorded about these things.
. State what form the data takes.
. State any other limiting information, such as time period of validity
of the data.
. Add purpose of data resource where relevant (e.g. for survey data).
. Include a description of the extent or location.
. Include legal references.
. Aim to be understood by non-experts.
. Do not include general background information.
. Avoid jargon and unexplained abbreviations.
. Acronyms should be expanded to the full name along with the
abbreviated version at the beginning of the abstract. The abbreviated
version can then be used (see examples below).

Note: the Schematron validation will raise an error if the abstract is
less than 100 characters, or is the same as the title.

|Comment |The most important details of the description should be
summarised in the first sentence, or the first 256 characters.
