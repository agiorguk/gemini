|Definition |Reference date for the data resource

|Purpose and meaning |Dataset reference date is an identifying date for
the data resource. It is a notional date of 'publication' of the data
resource. It is different from Temporal extent which is the actual date
of the currency of the data. For example, an atlas might have the
reference date '2007', but the data will have been collected over a
period prior to this.

|Obligation |Mandatory

|Occurrence |Multiple

|Data type |Class

|Domain a|
This class comprises two elements:

* Date as defined by BS ISO 8601
* Date type (publication/revision/creation).

The extended date format (YYYY-MM-DD) defined in BS ISO 8601 should be
used, where YYYY is the year, MM is the month and DD is the day. It may
be extended to include time (HH:MM:SS), where HH is the hour, MM the
minutes and SS the seconds, with the two parts separated by the
character 'T'.

|Guidance a|
. Dates may be to any degree of precision, from year (YYYY) to full date
and time. The extended date format (YYYY-MM-DD) defined in BS ISO 8601
should be used, where YYYY is the year, MM the month and DD the day. It
may be extended to include time (-HH:MM:SS, where HH is the hour, MM the
minute and SS the second), with 'T' separating the two parts.
. Identify whether date refers to creation, last revision or
publication.
. More than one Dataset Reference Date may be defined, but there must
only be one of type 'creation' and only one of type 'revision'
. The date should be completed to a resolution sufficient to identify
the version. Thus if the data resource is updated annually, only a year
is required, whilst if it is updated weekly, a day is required.
. If the resource is continuously updated or is a dataset series (e.g. a
map series), then a notional current date should be provided at a
suitable level of resolution.

|Comment |INSPIRE recommends that at least the date of the last revision
should be reported for spatial datasets

|Examples a|
* 2001, publication
* 2005-05, publication
* 1997-10-01, publication
* 2009-05-02T09:10:01, publication

|Guidelines
|
* The encoding for dataset reference date is shown in Example One.
* Dates may be expressed with low precision, as shown in the example.
GEMINI2 also allows the date and time to be published in metadata. In
this case the date encoding shown in Example Two must be used.
* The format of date and date-time values is described at
link:1048-uk-gemini-encoding-guidance.html#_dates_and_times[Dates and Times]
* Dataset reference date shall include a date type. The content of this
XML element is drawn from a
link:1048-uk-gemini-encoding-guidance.html#_code_lists[code list].

.Metadata errors observed...
[%collapsible]
====
|===
|Errors observed a|
*Confusion of Date and DateTime* +
In ISO 19115, Date and DateTime are distinct types. Although in many
elements, either is allowed, the XML encoding needs to be explicit about
which is given. It is an error to put a date (such as 2010-05-12) in a
DateTime element. +
Example of invalid structure: +

....
      
<gmd:dateStamp>
  <gco:DateTime>2012-11-15</gco:DateTime>
</gmd:dateStamp>
       
....

This should either include the time, for example: +

....
<gmd:dateStamp>
  <gco:DateTime>2012-11-15T13:50:38</gco:DateTime>
</gmd:dateStamp>
       
....

Or be explicit that it doesn't: +

....
<gmd:dateStamp>
  <gco:Date>2012-11-15</gco:Date>
</gmd:dateStamp>
....
