|===
|UK GEMINI id |38

|Definition |Identifier of a dataset that the service operates on

|Purpose and meaning |This identifies the dataset(s) associated with the
service

|Obligation |Conditional - mandatory for View and Download services,
optional for other service types.

|Occurrence |Multiple

|Data type |CharacterString

|Domain |Resource identifier or locator of the data resource

|Guidance a|
. Identify the data resources on which the service operates
. Enter the corresponding URL for the published data metadata record.
This may be:
* an OGC CSW GetRecordById request
* an address of a metadata instance in a WAF

|Guidelines a|
. https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/documents/inspire-metadata-implementing-rules-technical-guidelines-based-en-iso-19115-and-en-iso-1[INSPIRE
guidance] link:component/content/article?id=1047[[9]] states that
Coupled resource shall be implemented by reference, i.e. through a URL
that points to the metadata record of the data on which the service
operates; a Coupled resource is implemented using XLinking.
. Coupled resource is encoded using the operatesOn XML element in the
srv namespace. The data type of this element is the
MD_DataIdentification XML element in the gmd namespace.
. The srv:operatesOn element shall contain a Unique Resource Identifier,
(not to be confused with a W3C URI) through an an xlink:href attribute,
pointing to the gmd:MD_DataIdentification element of the metadata record
of the provided dataset or dataset series. The value of the xlink
attribute shall be a URL that allows access to an unambiguous metadata
instance, which may be:
* an OGC CSW GetRecordById request
* an address of a metadata instance in a WAF
. The approach defined here follows
https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/documents/technical-guidance-implementation-inspire-view-services-1[INSPIRE
technical guidance for view services]
link:component/content/article?id=1047[[16]] (see page 23 Implementation
Requirement 14)
. The obligation on coupled resource is conditional: it is mandatory (in
INSPIRE metadata regulations and hence GEMINI2) if a linkage to the
datasets on which the service operates is available. This is always the
case for view and download services so if the service metadata is about
a view (e.g a WMS) or download service (e.g. a WCS or WFS), Coupled
resource is effectively mandatory. Other types of service, such as
transformation, may not be coupled to a data resource so the constraint
on the element is not enforced by validation (i.e. XSD schema or
Schematron). Implementers may wish to declare a Coupled resource for
other non-view service types and in these cases the coupled resource
will not necessarily be a dataset.
. Example One shows encoding coupled resource using the by reference
mechanism and an OGC CSW GetRecordById request.
. Example Two shows encoding Coupled resource with a reference to a
metadata instance in a WAF.
. Example Three shows a variant of a CSW GetRecordById request, where a
fragment identifier is used to identify the specific
MD_DataIdentification element operated on by the service.
. It should be noted that both an OGC CSW GetRecordById and a WAF
available metadata instance are full metadata instances which may
contain more than one MD_DataIdentification element, in accordance with
ISO 19115. Therefore, an application wishing to dereference the
operatesOn element must 'know' which MD_DataIdentification element to
obtain from the metadata instance. In the case of GEMINI and INSPIRE
metadata it will be the first MD_DataIdentification element in the
instance (XPath //gmd:identificationInfo[1]) unless a fragment
identifier is used, in which case it may be in any location.

Example Three using the by reference mechanism and an OGC CSW request
with a fragment identifier.

In this example the fragment identifier #BGS-13480426 would correspond
to the value of the id attribute of the gmd:MD_DataIdentification
element of the dataset metadata record, like below

....
<gmd:MD_DataIdentification id="BGS-13480426">

.Metadata errors observed...
[%collapsible]
====
|===
|Errors observed a|
*Missing coupled resource* +
INSPIRE requires Coupled resource to be populated where relevant. +
This effectively makes it mandatory for View & Download services, and
the INSPIRE Geoportal reports this as a validation issue. +
However, the Geoportal also reports this issue for a Discovery service
metadata record, where coupled resource is not mandatory. +
*Encoding by value* A by value encoding is shown below; this is not
allowed by the INSPIRE encoding guidance. Note that the xlink:href
attribute of the operatesOn element has been removed and that the
operatesOn element now contains an MD_DataIdentification element.
