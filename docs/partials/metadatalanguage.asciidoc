|Guidance a|
. It is recommended to select a value from a controlled vocabulary, for
example that provided by ISO 639-2 which uses three-letter primary tags
with optional subtags.
. The values for the UK are:
+
[cols=",",]
!===
!English !eng
!Welsh !cym^*^
!Irish !gle
!Gaelic (Scottish) !gla
!Cornish !cor
!Ulster Scots !sco
!===
+
^*^ISO 639/2 has two codes for Welsh: textual ('cym') and bibliographic
('wel'). For GEMINI we recommend using cym, which abbreviates that
language's own name for itself.
. Other official European languages are listed at
http://ec.europa.eu/languages/policy/linguistic-diversity/official-languages-eu_en.htm[Official
languages of the EU].
. In general, a default value of 'eng' can be applied.
. If there is only a small amount of metadata in a second language, e.g.
Alternative title, then Metadata language should still indicate the main
language.

|Comment |For INSPIRE, the metadata itself must be in one of the
official European languages, such as English or Irish.

|Errors observed |*Metadata language missing* +
Metadata language is optional in ISO 19115 and GEMINI 2.2, but mandatory
for INSPIRE and therefore in GEMINI 2.3. This is now checked by the UK
Location GEMINI schematron.
