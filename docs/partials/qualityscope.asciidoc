|Guidance a|
. For the conformity statement and lineage of metadata describing:
* a dataset, set quality scope to 'dataset'
* a dataset series, set quality scope 'series'
. If using a Data Quality element to describe something other than the
whole dataset or series, then provide additional DQ_DataQuality elements
with their Scope set appropriately

|Comment |Required in the ISO 19115 encoding of GEMINI 2 metadata
records, to assist in managing related metadata records.

|Guidelines a|
ifdef::variant-dataset[]
All gmd:dataQualityInfo XML element shall have a gmd:scope XML element,
set to as appropriate.

There shall be exactly one gmd:dataQualityInfo/gmd:DQ_DataQuality
element scoped to the entire described data set or data set series. This
shall contain the Conformity and Lineage elements, and any Quality
measures that relate to the the entire dataset or series

Other quality measures, e.g. for specific feature types, shall be
separate DQ_DataQuality elements, with the relevant Quality scope. In
these cases the Level Description must also be set
endif::[]
ifdef::variant-service[]
* It is important to note that if the scope of the data quality
information is 'service' then the gmd:levelDescription XML element is
required
* The value of gmd:other must be *service* (in the language of the
metadata), as shown below.

|Errors observed |*No level description* +
ISO 19115 requires that a 'level description' is given for any quality
statement that is not describing the 'dataset' or 'series' level.
INSPIRE and GEMINI use the quality statement for both lineage and
conformity. This means that any 'service' record must provide a
gmd:DQ_Scope/gmd:levelDescription element, as shown above. +
A similar rule applies to link:#47[hierarchyLevelName], which must be
provided for any record that is not describing a dataset.
