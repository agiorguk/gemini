|Definition |Extent of data resource

|Purpose and meaning |This element defines the geographical extent of
coverage of the data resource relative to an administrative hierarchy.
It enables searches to be carried out to find data relevant to the area
of interest. Extent polygons can be implied through reference to an
external gazetteer. Note that Extent is the coverage of the data
resource, not the individual objects in the data resource. Thus if the
data resource was national parks in England, the Extent would be
'England', even though many parts of England do not have National Parks.

|Obligation |Optional

|Occurrence |Multiple

|Data type |Class

|Domain a|
The class comprises two elements:

* (Optional) Authority code
* Code identifying the extent

|Guidance a|
. An area approximating to the extent of coverage of the data resource
should be chosen. Where the extent does not coincide with any defined
area or areas, then either the nearest equivalent including the area of
coverage, or a set of multiple areas that make up the coverage should be
provided.
. This should not be over-generalised (i.e. do not take it as Great
Britain if it only covers England and Wales).

|Comment |

|Examples a|
* England
* East Anglia
* The Wash
* http://data.os.uk/id/7000000000041546 Central Scotland, using OS
linked data as a gazetteer
* https://local-authority-eng.register.gov.uk/record/GLA, Greater London
Authority, using GDS "Local authorities in England" as a controlled list
* http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/C64/current/5/, Irish Sea, in the
NERC Vocabulary "C64, United Kingdom Charting Progress 2 sea regions"

|Guidelines
|
. The examples shown below use codes (URIs in URL form) from the
http://data.os.uk[Ordnance Survey Linked Data]
link:component/content/article?id=1047[[22]]
http://data.os.uk/datasets/boundary-line[boundary data]. The code
element can be used as a URL returning a page on the internet providing
further information. The code in Example One, ending in
7000000000041546, is the URL for Central Scotland. Associated with this
code is further information, such as the geometry of Central Scotland.
. The entity responsible for managing the extent code can be expressed
in GEMINI metadata. An example of the encoding is shown in Example Two
. Recommended best practice is to select a human readable value from a
controlled vocabulary. An example from the Marine Geospatial community
is http://seadatanet.maris2.nl/v_bodc_vocab_v2/search.asp?lib=C19
. INSPIRE recommendations for encoding free text values which reference
a specific external resource or registry is to use gmx:Anchor instead of
gco:CharacterString
# tag::dataset[]
Note that the extent XML element is in the gmd namespace for
datasets/series. This differs from service metadata instances where the
extent XML element will be in the srv namespace.

# tag::service[]
Note that the extent XML element is in the srv namespace. This differs
from dataset metadata instances where the extent XML element will be in
