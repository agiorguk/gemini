|Guidance a|
. Identify a bounding box slightly larger than the extent of the data
resource, and determine the coordinates of the boundaries. It may be
necessary to convert from another coordinate system (e.g. National Grid)
into lat/long.
. Only approximate values are required, sufficient to identify the
extent on a global basis. The bounding box is implicitly in WGS84.

|Comment |The bounding box will often cover areas that are not directly
related to the area covered by the resource.

.Encoding guidelines...
[%collapsible]
====
|===
|Guidelines a|
. The encoding example for geographic bounding box for datasets is shown
in the example
. Note that the extent XML element is in the gmd namespace. This differs
from service metadata instances where the extent XML element will be in
the srv namespace.
. The definition of the equivalent ISO 19115 class,
EX_GeographicBoundingBox, is 'Geographic area of the entire dataset
referenced to WGS 84'. Consequently, the CRS of the coordinates
expressed in metadata is always WGS 84 (identified by the EPSG URI
http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4326). This means that the
coordinate values shall be expressed in units of degrees (encoded using
decimal numbers) with axes orientated north and east. The geodetic datum
is WGS 84.

ifdef::variant-service[]
Note that the encoding is very similar to that used in metadata
instances for datasets or series, except that the extent XML element is
in the srv namespace instead of gmd. This is because extent is a
property of MD_DataIdentification (ISO 19115) and
SV_ServiceIdentification (ISO 19119/Amd 1:2008), not a property of the
parent MD_Identification.

.Metadata errors observed...
[%collapsible]
====
|===
|Errors observed a|
*Overly precise bounding box* +
GEMINI states that the bounding latitude and longitude should be stated
to at least two decimal places. The INSPIRE geoportal used to report two
decimal places as an error; it does not now. However, some software
defaults to values that are unnecessarily "precise". For example: +

....
<gmd:westBoundLongitude>
  <gco:Decimal>-8.17548890898914</gco:Decimal>
</gmd:westBoundLongitude>
....

Six decimal places of a degree is something like 1cm, so the longitude
above is being given to roughly the nearest molecule.
