|UK GEMINI id |50

|Definition |The method used to spatially represent geographic
information

|Purpose and meaning |The type in which the spatial data is represented
may be of importance when evaluating the fit for purpose of the dataset.
The code list value of this element is intended for describing this
information.

|Obligation |Mandatory

|Occurrence |Multiple

|Data type |Class (CodeList)

|Domain a|
MD_SpatialRepresentationTypeCode from ISO 19115. Codes to be used are:

. vector
. grid
. tin
. textTable

|Guidance a|
. tin stands for triangulated irregular network. TIN is a digital data
structure used in a geographic information system (GIS) for the
representation of a surface
. textTable should be used for datasets with an indirect spatial
reference
. grid should be used for images and coverage data

|Comment |This element is regarded by the INSPIRE metadata technical
guidance as interoperability metadata for datasets and dataset series
