|Definition |Value uniquely identifying the data resource

|Purpose and meaning |The purpose of this is to uniquely identify the
data resource.

|Obligation |Mandatory for datasets and dataset series

|Occurrence |Multiple

|Data type |Class

|Domain a|
The class comprises the following elements:

* Code - Identifier code or name, often from a controlled list or
pattern defined by a code space.
* Codespace - Identifier of a code space within which one or more codes
are defined.

These elements are described in the table below

!Other comments !- !This code space is often defined by some authority

range and format of each code space identifier is defined by that code

|Guidance a|
. The code is generally assigned by some authority, with a codespace
uniquely identifying the context of the identifier code.
. The codespace must be a character string that uniquely identifies the
namespace for the identifier code. This should be the internet domain of
the data owner/provider, +
e.g.: data.bgs.ac.uk/id/dataHolding/
. The resource is identified by a unique identifier code, generally
assigned by the data owner. A character string namespace uniquely
identifying the context of the identifier code may be added for
uniqueness. This is usually allocated by an appropriate authority such
as the manager of the spatial data infrastructure.
. Where present, a DOI should be recorded as a resource identifier, with
the codespace being doi. If a DOI landing page is also available, then
include this using an Anchor.

|Comment |Since INSPIRE metadata technical guidance version 2, it is no
longer required to use RS_Identifier if a value for code space value is
provided. +
In such cases (where there is a code space provided) it is now strongly
recommended to use MD_Identifier and encode the complete URI in the code
element.

|Examples a|
* image2000_1_nl2_multi
* doi:10.5285/1e7d5e08-9e24-471b-ae37-49b477f695e3

.Encoding guidelines...
[%collapsible]
====
|===
|Guidelines a|
. The resource identifier can be a globally unique identifier such as a
UUID, in which case it is encoded as shown in Example One.
. The form used in Example One can also be used if the identifier is
expressed as a code space and code in URI form like
http://image2000.jrc.it#image2000_1_nl2_multi However a better way to do
this is to use the gmx:Anchor as in Example Two.
. Note that the identifier is encoded in the citation of the metadata
instance
. A resource identifier (which may be the same as the code) should also
be added to the 'id' attribute of the gmd:MD_DataIdentification type.
This follows the examples in the
https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/documents/inspire-metadata-implementing-rules-technical-guidelines-based-en-iso-19115-and-en-iso-1[INSPIRE
guidance] link:component/content/article?id=1047[[9]].
. Care must be taken with the value of the id attribute code. The
attribute 'id' has the data type xs:ID which must have as its value an
XML name. This means that it cannot start with a number, and has a
restricted set of characters it can include. This means that normally it
cannot be an UUID or an URI. The id must also be unique across all id
attributes in the metadata document
. See notes on link:component/content/article?id=1048#2.2.12[XML
Identifiers].
